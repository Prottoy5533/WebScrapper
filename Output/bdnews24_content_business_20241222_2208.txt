Title: Starbucks workers' union strikes across US as talks hit impasse

Workers demand better pay, more staff, better schedules, the union says adding the strike could reach 'hundreds of stores' by Dec 24

Some members of the Starbucks workers' union that represents more than 10,000 baristas walked off their jobs in multiple US cities on Friday, citing unresolved issues over wages, staffing and schedules.

The five-day strike, which began on Friday and closed Starbucks cafes in Los Angeles, Chicago and Seattle, will expand to Columbus, Denver, and Pittsburgh through Saturday, the union said in a statement.

This is the latest in a series of labour actions that have picked up pace across service industries following a period when workers at manufacturers in the automotive, aerospace and rail industries won substantial concessions from employers.

At Starbucks, the Workers United union, which represents employees at 525 stores across the US, said late on Thursday that walkouts would escalate daily, and could reach "hundreds of stores" nationwide by Christmas Eve.

"It's estimated that 10 stores out of 10,000 company-operated stores did not open today," Starbucks said, adding that there was no significant impact to store operations on Friday.

Around 20 people joined a picket line at a Starbucks location on Chicago's north side, buffeted by snow and wind, but cheering in response to the honking horns of passing cars.

A few confused customers tried to walk into the closed store before strikers began chanting, but union member Shep Searl said the reaction had been mostly positive.

Searl said 100% of the unionized workers at the Starbucks location in Chicago's Edgewater neighborhood were participating in the strike, and according to the workers, they have been subject to numerous unfair labor practices including write-ups, "captive-audience" meetings and firings.

The union member said they made about $21 an hour and added, "that would have been a great wage in 2013".

It is an inadequate wage, the baristas said, given inflation and the high cost of living in a large city, especially since they rarely get 40-hour work weeks.

WORKERS SNUB OFFER

Negotiations between the company and Workers United began in April, based on an established framework agreed upon in February, which could also help resolve numerous pending legal disputes.

The company said on Thursday it has held more than nine bargaining sessions with the union since April, and reached more than 30 agreements on "hundreds of topics", including economic issues.

The Seattle-headquartered firm said it is ready to continue negotiations, claiming the union delegates prematurely ended the bargaining session this week.

The union, however, said in a Facebook post on Friday that Starbucks had yet to present a serious economic proposal with less than two weeks remaining until the year-end contract deadline.

The workers' group also snubbed an offer of no immediate wage hike and a guarantee of a 1.5% increase in future years.

"Workers United proposals call for an immediate increase in the minimum wage of hourly partners by 64%, and by 77% over the life of a three-year contract. This is not sustainable," Starbucks said on Friday.

In response to Starbucks' statement on the proposals, Michelle Eisen, a Starbucks barista and bargaining delegate, said, "Starbucks' characterization of our proposals is misleading and they know it. We are ready to finalise a framework that includes new investments in baristas in the first year of contracts".

Separately, the baristas' union said on Friday that it filed a new labour practice charge against the coffee house, alleging Starbucks "refused to bargain and engaged in bad faith bargaining" over economic issues.

Hundreds of complaints have been filed with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), accusing Starbucks of unlawful labour practices such as firing union supporters and closing stores during labour campaigns. Starbucks has denied wrongdoing and said it respects the right of workers to choose whether to unionise.

WORKING ON A TURNAROUND

Last month, the NLRB said that Starbucks broke the law by telling workers at its flagship Seattle cafe that they would lose benefits if they joined a union.

"It's (the strike) taking place during one of the busiest times of the year for Starbucks, which could magnify its impact while bringing unwanted public scrutiny into the company's labour practices," Emarketer analyst Rachel Wolff said.

The coffee chain is working on a turnaround under its newly appointed top boss, Brian Niccol, who aims to restore "coffee house culture" by overhauling cafes and simplifying its menu among other measures.

"Given how much Starbucks is already struggling to win over customers, it can ill afford any negative publicity - or impact to sales - that the strike could bring," Wolff said.

The Starbucks workers' strike comes in the same week as Amazon.com workers at seven US facilities walking off the job on Thursday, during the holiday shopping rush.

There were 33 work stoppages in 2023, the most since 2000, though far lower than in past decades, data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics showed.



Title: Soybean oil crisis lingers as rising prices spill over into 'old' bottles

The president of the Edible Oil Wholesalers Association says companies want to make a profit

The supply of soybean oil in Dhaka's retail markets has slightly improved following an official price hike, but it still falls short of meeting demand, sparking objections over the pricing.

Several customers in the capital's Karwan Bazar, Mohakhali, and Niketan kitchen markets alleged that there is a shortage of 1-litre and 2-litre of bottled soybean oil in numerous shops.

They said although the old price is written on the label of the bottle, the extra price is being charged.

The retailers say they are not getting enough oil to keep up with demand, claiming information about many wholesalers who have started stocking oil before Ramadan.

Golam Mawla, president of the Edible Oil Wholesalers Association, told bdnews24.com that the S Alam Group used to supply large quantities of cooking oil to the market; they are closed.

"City Group is facing a shortage and their products are probably on the way. There could be a supply crisis."

Disagreeing with the allegations of stockpiling, he said: "How many thousand tonnes of oil are possible to hoard? Where is such a place to stock bottled oil? It's not a thing. Another reason could be that companies want to make more profit."

On Dec 9, the government increased the price of the product by Tk 8 per litre amid the "disappearance" of soybean oil from all small and big markets for several weeks, citing soaring prices in the global market.

According to the announcement, the maximum retail price of per litre bottled soybean oil has now been fixed at Tk 175, up by Tk 8. The maximum retail price of open soybean and palm oil will be Tk 157; a 5-litre bottle of soybean oil will be available for Tk 852.

On the day of the price hike [Dec 9], Commerce Advisor Sheikh Bashir Uddin said: “We have set a reasonable price after talking to the companies. There won't be any problem."

Since that day, the supply of bottled soybean oil in the capital’s kitchen markets has continued to increase. But “the problem” is still not completely solved.

A person named Hamid Akand went to a few shops in the Mohakhali kitchen market to buy oil on Saturday.

"The supply of oil in the market is still the same as it was before; it is not normal; the crisis remains," he told bdnews24.com.

"Some shops have 2-litre of bottled oil, but not 1-litre. Where there is 1-litre, there is no 5-litre. In some places, open oil is being sold for more than the price fixed by the government."

Salma Begum, a housewife who came to Niketan raw market, also echoes Hamid, saying  "Soybean oil is still not available in the market.”

"The prices of petrol and diesel are much higher than the government fixed rates. I bought open soybean oil for Tk 180 per litre."

Abdur Rahman, another shopper at the market, told bdnews24.com: "I took a 1-litre bottled oil at Tk 175. But Tk 167 is written on the bottle.”

The sellers argue that they have purchased the oil at the new price. That's why they have to keep more.

Mustafa Haider, president of the Bangladesh Edible Oil Association, said: "We have been working for a few days on how to ensure adequate supply in the market."



Title: Honda and Nissan consider mutual production of vehicles, Kyodo reports

Honda will consider supplying hybrid vehicles to Nissan as part of a plan, report says

Honda 7267.T and Nissan 7201.T are considering producing vehicles in one another's factories as part of their plan to deepen ties and potentially merge, Japan's Kyodo news agency said on Saturday.

Honda will consider supplying hybrid vehicles to Nissan as part of the plan, the report said, without citing the source of the information.

A merger of Honda, Japan's second-largest car company, and Nissan, its third-largest, would create the world's third-largest auto group by vehicle sales, behind Toyota 7203.T and Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, making 7.4 million vehicles a year.

The two automakers forged a strategic partnership in March to cooperate in electric vehicle development, but Nissan has faced financial and strategic troubles in recent months.

As announced, Honda, "Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors are in the process of bringing together our strengths and exploring potential forms of cooperation, but nothing has been decided yet", a Honda spokesperson said, when asked about the report.

Nissan declined to comment, saying the details of the report were not based on a company announcement. Nissan is the top shareholder in Mitsubishi Motors 7211.T.

Kyodo said Honda could use Nissan's car factory in Britain, as it now only has factories for engines and motorcycles in Europe.

The move comes amid concerns over how president-elect Donald Trump's policies may shake up manufacturing with his promises of protectionist trade policies, the report said.



Title: High court orders two-week status quo on Nagad administrator's activities

The order bars new actions by the administrator and board until Jan 2

The High Court has ordered a two-week status quo on the activities of the administrator appointed to the mobile financial service provider “Nagad”.

The bench of Justice Farah Mahbub and Justice Debashish Roy Chowdhury issued the order on Wednesday, following a plea filed by the company’s Executive Director Md Shafayet Alam.

Lawyers Md Naushad Zamir and Abul Kalam Khan Daud represented the petitioner, while lawyer Saiful Islam appeared for Bangladesh Bank.

The order restricts the administrator and the board from initiating any new actions beyond regular business operations until Jan 2, lawyer Kalam told bdnews24.com.

He added that the High Court will deliver its final verdict after a hearing scheduled for Jan 2.

Following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina regime on Aug 5, a series of changes were made in the management of several government and private institutions.

On Aug 18, Bangladesh Bank appointed Badiuzzaman Didar, a director from its Chattogram office, as the administrator of Nagad for one year, with additional staff to assist him.

The previous board of directors of Nagad was also dissolved on the same day.

The petition filed by Shafayet challenges the administrator's appointment, naming the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications secretary, Bangladesh Bank governor, Payment Systems Department director, Directorate of Posts director general, and Badiuzzaman as respondents.

On Sept 17, after preliminary hearings, the High Court bench issued a rule questioning why the appointment of the Bangladesh Bank administrator at Nagad should not be declared illegal and unlawful.

Nagad, which started as a mobile financial service provider, was later granted a digital bank licence.

The decision to appoint an administrator came shortly after a request for detailed information regarding the five foreign investors in Nagad's digital bank.



Title: US consumer spending solid; inflation showing progress as year ends

A Commerce Department report showed moderate monthly rises in prices, with a measure of underlying inflation posting its smallest gain in 6 months

US consumer spending increased in November amid strong demand for a range of goods and services, underscoring the economy's resilience, which saw the Federal Reserve this week projecting fewer interest rate cuts in 2025 than it had in September.

There was also good news on inflation last month after a series of warmer readings. The report from the Commerce Department on Friday showed moderate monthly rises in prices, with a measure of underlying inflation posting its smallest gain in six months. Nonetheless, the annual increase in core inflation, excluding food and energy, remained stubbornly well above the US central bank's 2% target.

There are also worries that plans by President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration to cut taxes, impose or raise tariffs on imports and deport millions of undocumented immigrants would stoke inflation.

"The economy continues to grow from strong consumer demand as income growth and the wealth effect from higher portfolio values give consumers capacity to spend," said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. "Inflation was more benign than expected but the stickiness of some categories supports the Fed's hesitancy to materially lower rates next year."

Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic activity, rose 0.4% last month after a downwardly revised 0.3% gain in October, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending advancing 0.5% after a previously reported 0.4% rise in October.

The nearly broad-based increase in spending was led by new motor vehicles, likely in part as households replaced vehicles damaged during Hurricanes Helene and Milton. That accounted for the bulk of the 0.8% rebound in goods outlays.

Spending on recreational goods and vehicles also rose as did outlays on financial services and insurance, mostly charges, fees and commissions. There was also increased spending on recreation services, healthcare, clothing and footwear, furniture as well as housing and utilities.

Spending at restaurants and bars as well as on hotel and motel stays also increased. Spending on services rose 0.2%.

When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 0.3% after edging up 0.1% in October. The so-called real consumer spending is running at an annualized rate of 3.1% in the first two months of the fourth quarter.

"That will lay the foundation for another very solid GDP number for the fourth quarter," said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP.

Consumer spending surged at a 3.7% pace in the third quarter, the fastest in 1-1/2 years, helping to propel the economy to a 3.1% growth rate following a 3.0% pace of expansion in the April-June quarter.

The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product increasing at a 3.1% rate in the fourth quarter.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday described the economy as having "just been remarkable," adding "I feel very good about ... the performance of the economy and we want to keep that going." The central bank on Wednesday cut its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points to the 4.25%-4.50% range. It forecast only two rate reductions in 2025, in a nod to the economy's continued resilience and still-high inflation.

In September, Fed officials had forecast four quarter-point rate cuts next year. The shallower rate cut path in the latest projections also reflected uncertainty over policiesfrom the incoming Trump administration.

Stocks on Wall Street traded higher. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. US Treasury yields fell.

STRONG WAGE GAINS

Labour market stamina, marked by low layoffs and strong wage growth, is underpinning consumer spending. Strong household balance sheets, reflecting high stock market and home prices are also driving spending. Household savings remain supportive.

Economists, however, cautioned that it was mostly middle- and higher-income households that were benefiting from the wage gains and wealth effects, noting that lower-income consumers were under financial pressure.

Personal income rose 0.3%, with wages shooting up 0.6%. Income at the disposal of households after accounting for inflation rose 0.2%, meaning some tapped their savings to fund purchases. The saving rate dipped to 4.4% from 4.5% in October.

Economists did not believe that the moderation in inflation last month would have changed the tone of the Fed's message on Wednesday. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.1% after an unrevised 0.2% gain in October.

Goods prices were unchanged after three straight monthly decreases. Motor vehicle prices increased 0.7%, but the cost of recreational goods and vehicles fell for the fourth consecutive month. Services prices rose 0.2% after gaining 0.4% in October.

Housing inflation increased at the slowest pace since April 2021, reflecting a moderation in rents. The cost of food and accommodation services rose by the most in 10 months.

In the 12 months through November, the PCE price index advanced 2.4% after rising 2.3% in October.

The increase in the annual inflation rate was partly due to last year's low readings dropping out of the calculation.

Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index climbed 0.1%. That was the smallest rise since May, and followed an unrevised 0.3% gain in October. Core inflation was running at a 2.5% rate in the last three months.

In the 12 months through November, core prices increased 2.8% after advancing by the same margin in October.

The Fed tracks the PCE price measures for monetary policy. It hiked its policy rate by 5.25 percentage points between March 2022 and July 2023.

"The general disinflation trend, in view of the much higher US dollar, is intact for the next two months," said Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Boston College. "However, if the incoming administration raises tariffs significantly, that will provoke retaliation and usher in a period of stagflation that will rival the stagflation of the 1970s."



Title: Oil prices fall on demand concerns, strong dollar

Brent crude futures fell by 31 cents, or 0.43%, to $72.57 a barrel by 0139 GMT

Oil prices fell in early trading on Friday on worries about demand growth in 2025, especially in top crude importer China, putting global oil benchmarks on track to end the week down more than 2%.

Brent crude futures fell by 31 cents, or 0.43%, to $72.57 a barrel by 0139 GMT. US West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 26 cents, or 0.26%, to $69.12 per barrel.

Chinese state-owned refiner Sinopec said in its annual energy outlook, released on Thursday, that China's imports could peak as soon as 2025 and the country's oil consumption would peak by 2027 as diesel and gasoline demand weaken.

The dollar's climb to a two-year high also weighed on oil prices, after the Federal Reserve flagged it would be cautious about cutting interest rates in 2025.

A stronger dollar makes oil more expensive for holders of other currencies, while a slower pace of rate cuts could dampen economic growth and trim oil demand.

In a move that could pare supply, G7 countries are considering ways to tighten the price cap on Russian oil, such as with an outright ban or by lowering the price threshold, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. Russia has evaded the $60 per barrel cap imposed in 2022 using its "shadow fleet" of ships, which the EU and Britain have targeted with further sanctions in recent days.



Title: FedEx to spin off its freight trucking business

Shares jumped 8% in after-hours trading, adding $5 billion to FedEx's market capitalisation

FedEx announced the much-anticipated spinoff of its freight trucking division on Thursday, as it restructures operations to focus on its core delivery business.

Shares jumped 8% in after-hours trading, adding $5 billion to FedEx's market capitalisation.

Analysts believe the spinoff could unlock up to $20 billion in shareholder value, while clearing the way for FedEx management to zero in on merging operations of its separate Express and Ground units to boost profits. They say FedEx Freight assets were not fully appreciated within FedEx and that spinning off the trucking business as a publicly-held entity will provide an opportunity to expand and improve its operations.

Freight is one of FedEx's most profitable businesses, said Edward Jones analyst Faisal Hersi. The company trades at a relative discount to its publicly held trucking rivals like XPO and Old Dominion, meaning that making it an independent company will create value for investors, he said.

"We are encouraged that the company listened to shareholder feedback and is pursuing this route," Stephens analyst Daniel Imbro said of the spinoff.

FedEx Freight is the largest US provider of less-than-truckload services, which involve carrying multiple shipments from different customers on a single truck; the shipments are then routed through a network of service centers where they get transferred to other trucks with similar destinations. The unit's revenue fell 11% to $2.17 billion during the fiscal second quarter ended Nov 30.

Executives said FedEx Freight lost some cost-conscious customers that it had picked up after the bankruptcy of rival Yellow Corp and that the business appeared to have bottomed during the most recent quarter.

The after-hours rally in FedEx shares came despite its warning that 2025 revenue could be held back by a stubbornly challenging environment, with demand for its fastest and most lucrative deliveries from business customers remaining weak.

As a result, Memphis-based FedEx lowered its profit outlook for the full year ending May 2025, calling for adjusted profit of $19 to $20 per share. In September, FedEx cut the top end of its full-year adjusted operating income to between $20 and $21 per share from its previous range of $20 to $22 per share.

FedEx second-quarter adjusted profit fell to $0.99 billion, or $4.05 per share, from $1.01 billion, or $3.99 per share, a year earlier. Nevertheless, the result from the latest quarter topped analysts' average call for earnings of $3.90 per share, according to LSEG.

FedEx Freight turned in lower-than-expected revenue and profit during the latest quarter, due to continued weakness in the US industrial segment that includes manufacturing, metals and chemicals. That was mostly offset by ongoing cost-cutting at the company, which is slashing overhead and working to improve efficiency.

The Express unit's adjusted results improved during the quarter, helped by expense reductions and more international export volume, FedEx said. That was partly offset by higher wage and lease rates, weak US package delivery demand and the expiration of the US Postal Service contract for air transportation services on Sept 29, 2024.

FedEx again warned that the loss of USPS, its largest customer, would create a $500 million headwind in the current fiscal year.

The company and rivals like United Parcel Service are in the throes of the US holiday shipping season, when daily volumes can double.

Thanksgiving fell later than normal this year, shortening the time the companies have to deliver gifts to shoppers and inventory to retailers.

December volumes so far are ahead of FedEx's forecasts and picked up right after Cyber Monday - the first work day after Thanksgiving, when many people make online purchases.

Carriers are still shouldered with excess capacity from the early COVID shipping boom, so experts say most holiday gifts should be delivered on time.



Title: Global central banks urge caution before Trump arrival

Uncertainty grows as Trump rejects funding bill

The imminent arrival of Donald Trump in the White House was already shaping global economic policy-making this week as the US Federal Reserve flagged fewer rate cuts and other leading central banks signalled caution over their rate paths.

The Fed cut rates as expected on Wednesday but accompanied the move with a message that the incoming Trump administration gave cause for caution - a sentiment echoed by its counterparts in London, Tokyo, Frankfurt and elsewhere.

As Fed officials dialed back projections for future easing in the face of stubborn inflation, Chair Jerome Powell said some in the bank were trying to judge how Trump's planned tariffs, lower taxes and immigration curbs might affect policy.

"Some people did take a very preliminary step and start to incorporate highly conditional estimates of economic effects of policies into their forecasts at this meeting," Powell said of higher estimates for both growth and inflation in 2025.

Powell's repeated urging of caution around further rate cuts triggered a slide in stock prices. Just a single Fed rate cut is now priced in for 2025.

As expected, the Bank of England kept its main interest rate unchanged at 4.75% on Thursday and said it needed to stick to its existing gradual approach to cutting rates.

"With the heightened uncertainty in the economy we can't commit to when or by how much we will cut rates in the coming year," BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said.

Earlier in Asia, the Bank of Japan kept ultra-low interest rates as the threat of Trump's policies cast a shadow over the export-reliant economy.

"There's uncertainty over the policies of the incoming US administration, so we need to scrutinise the impact more carefully," BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda told a press conference, adding that Trump trade and fiscal policies would have a huge impact on the global economy and financial markets.

A Reuters survey of Japanese businesses published last week showed nearly three-quarters expect Trump to have a negative effect on their operating environment.

Norway's central bank held its policy interest rate unchanged at a 16-year high of 4.50% and highlighted the risk of a trade war between the United States and China.

"Higher tariffs will likely dampen global growth, but the implications for price prospects in Norway are uncertain," the bank said.

Sweden's central bank cut its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 2.50% as expected, but said it now saw reasons to be more cautious about cutting rates in early 2025.

In central Europe, the Czech National Bank paused its year-long rate-cutting campaign as expected, with lingering inflation pressures, especially for services, keeping it cautious.

UPHEAVAL

The US economy was thrown into further uncertainty after Trump pressured fellow Republicans in Congress to reject a bill to keep the government funded past the deadline of midnight on Friday and demanded lawmakers raise the nation's debt ceiling.

In the past week, the European Central Bank and Bank of Canada had already lowered interest rates. Both are seen easing further in 2025 amid weakening outlooks.

While ECB President Christine Lagarde was vague about further rate cuts, she went out of her way to emphasize downside risks to growth, including from prospective trade tensions with the United States under Trump.

Although Trump may have been just at the periphery of officials' thinking at the Fed, he was a central focus in Ottawa when Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland quit after clashing with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on how to handle possible US tariffs under the next US administration.

Meanwhile, crypto market enthusiasm for Trump's notion of establishing a strategic reserve of bitcoin was dealt a setback when Powell said that the Fed had no legal authority to hold it and no plan to seek a change in the law so that it could.

The remark contributed to a broad slide in crypto-related assets, including a 5% drop in bitcoin itself, its largest decline in more than three months.



Title: Bangladesh ready to push startups, business initiatives for youth, says CA Yunus

Bangladesh is ready to convene the first multi-stakeholders meeting in 2025, the chief advisor says

The D-8 governments can convene candid, result-oriented conversations involving youth communities on startups, business and finance to carve out new platforms amongst them and Bangladesh is ready to take such initiatives forward, says Muhammad Yunus, chief advisor to the interim government.

Bangladesh is ready to convene the first multi-stakeholders meeting in 2025, the chief advisor said as he addressed the 11th Summit of the D-8 Countries in Egypt’s Cairo on Thursday.

The D-8 members met at a time when the world was witnessing unprecedented challenges, Yunus said.

“Yet, so many opportunities beckon us as well.”

He said the theme of the summit, focusing on youth and the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), aptly resonated with shared aspirations. He also congratulated President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi of the Arab Republic of Egypt on his election.

Youth today are quickly embracing technology and innovation in everything, he said.

Often, they show uncanny imagination in tacking intractable climatic stress on-the-field, the chief advisor said.

He noted that agriculture and food were changing, economies were secured and wealth was created within societies with little outside inputs.

“I see how amazingly capable and competitive the SMEs are,” he said. “In the D-8 countries, collectively we possess enough wealth, even in private philanthropy, to stand by these scores of SMEs. With our modest support, we can shape a virtuous ‘cycle of good’, for them and our people. We need to let money flow to them, through de-risking finance, for instance.”

The D-8 countries have to re-invent ‘learning’ to make room for their boys and girls to become leaders of the economy, Yunus said.

The countries had great heritage, wisdom and accomplishments which could be blended and built using that foundation, he noted.

“We are yet to take fuller advantage of the digital revolution that has been with us for years. Now that AI is here, let us think if we can leapfrog and catch up with the disruptions, to the advantage of our entrepreneurial boys and girls,” Yunus said.

As a way forward, the chief advisor proposed two specific courses of action

Firstly, to build and deepen functional, impact-driven connections between the D-8 countries’ universities and equivalent knowledge institutions, particularly focused on preparing boys and girls for an entrepreneurial purpose other than its own sake.

“Our aim should be to generate knowledge output that can produce global secure business and industry from leaders of D8 countries in the fiercely competitive global marketplace, with our niche. If this asks to re-look at the D-8 trade and investment frameworks afresh, we should do so,” the chief advisor said.

Secondly, to think of a cooperative learning agenda that can complement the national undertakings now that basic AI-based tools and applications are accessible, he said.

For years, the D-8 countries tried to impart basic education and skills to millions in their countries through conventional in-person institutional architecture, which was often an increasingly daunting task.

“To reach ‘scale’, we tried through distance learning, for instance. We need to think deeper as to how to skill millions of young adults in a workplace where right attitudes – values – ethics matter as much as hard skills. And, then we also confront the challenge to re-skill many millions at different vocational streams, on a continuous basis,” the chief advisor said.



Title: Adani, under bribery scrutiny, pressed by Bangladesh to reopen power deal

The interim government accuses Adani Power of withholding tax benefits central to the deal

Bangladesh's interim government has accused energy supplier Adani Power of breaching a multi-billion-dollar agreement by withholding tax benefits that a power plant central to the deal received from New Delhi, according to documents seen by Reuters.

In 2017, the Indian company controlled by billionaire Gautam Adani signed an agreement with Bangladesh to provide power from its coal-fired plant in eastern India. Dhaka has said it hopes to renegotiate the deal, which was awarded by then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina without a tender process and costs Bangladesh far more than its other coal power deals, according to Bangladesh power agency documents and letters between the two parties reviewed by Reuters, as well as interviews with six Bangladesh officials.

Dhaka has been behind on payments to Adani Power since supply started in July 2023. It owes several hundred million dollars for energy that has already been supplied, though the two sides dispute the exact size of the bill.

Bangladesh's de facto power minister Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan told Reuters the country now had enough domestic capacity to cope without the Adani supply, though not all domestic power generators were operational.

Nobel peace prize laureate Muhammad Yunus took power in August after a student-led revolution ousted Hasina, who critics accuse of stifling democracy and mismanaging the economy. She ran Bangladesh for most of the last two decades and was a close ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Reuters is reporting for the first time that the contract came with an additional implementation agreement that addressed the transfer of tax benefits. The news agency is also revealing details about Bangladesh's plan to reopen the 25-year deal, and that it hopes to use the fallout from U.S. prosecutors' November indictment of Adani and seven other executives for their alleged role in a $265 million bribery scheme to press for a resolution.

Adani Power has not been accused of wrongdoing in Bangladesh. A company spokesperson said in response to Reuters' questions that it had upheld all contractual obligations and had no indication Dhaka was reviewing the contract. The company did not answer questions about the tax benefits and other issues raised by Bangladesh.

Adani Group has called the US allegations "baseless."

TAX EXEMPTIONS

Adani Power's Godda plant runs off imported coal and was built to serve Bangladesh.

The company said the Bangladesh deal helped further Indian foreign policy objectives and Delhi in 2019 declared the plant part of a special economic zone. It enjoys incentives such as exemptions on income tax and other levies.

The power supplier was required to inform Bangladesh swiftly of changes in the plant's tax status and to pass on the "benefit of a tax exemption" from India's government, according to the contract and implementation agreement signed on Nov. 5, 2017 between Adani Power and the state-run Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB).

But Adani Power did not do so, according to letters sent by BPDB on Sept 17, 2024 and Oct 22, 2024 that urged it to remit the benefits.

The agreements and letters are not public but were seen by Reuters.

Two BPDB officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to the media, said they did not receive responses.

BPDB estimates savings of roughly 0.35 cents per unit of power if the benefit was passed on, the officials said. The Godda plant supplied 8.16 billion units in the year to June 30, 2024, according to an undated Bangladesh government summary of power purchases seen by Reuters, suggesting potential savings of about $28.6 million.

Power minister Khan said the savings would be a key part of future discussions with Adani Power.

'NEGOTIATED HASTILY'

Bangladesh in November scrapped a 2010 law that allowed Hasina to award some energy deals without a competitive bidding process.

The absence of tenders is unusual, said Tim Buckley, director of Australia's Climate Energy Finance think-tank, adding that auctions ensure "the best price possible."

In September, Yunus's government appointed a panel of experts to examine major energy deals signed by Hasina. A Bangladesh court has separately ordered a probe of the Adani deal.

Another panel asked to study the economy said in a white paper submitted to Yunus on Dec 1 that the US charges against Adani meant Bangladesh should "scrutinise" the power deal, which it described as "negotiated hastily."

Hasina, who has not been seen in public since she fled to India, could not be reached. Her son and adviser Sajeeb Wazed told Reuters he was not aware of the Adani Power deal but that he was "sure there was no corruption."

"I can only assume the Indian government lobbied for this deal so it was made," he said in response to allegations of political interference.

Modi's office and other Indian officials did not respond to requests for comment.

HARDBALL

On Oct 31, Adani Power halved the power supply from Godda in response to the payment dispute with Bangladesh.

The company in a Jul 1 letter seen by Reuters also rejected a request from BPDB to extend a discount it had offered until May - resulting in savings of about $13 million for Bangladesh. It said it would not consider further discounts until payment was cleared.

Adani Power contends it is owed $900 million, while BPDB says arrears are about $650 million. Bangladesh suffers from a dollar shortage and BPBD officials told Reuters they haven't been able to obtain sufficient foreign currency for payment.

The halving of supply particularly angered Bangladesh, BPDB Chair Md Rezaul Karim said, because it came after Dhaka in October remitted $97 million to Adani Power - its highest monthly payment this year.

The dispute revolves around how power tariffs are calculated, with the 2017 agreement pricing off an average of two indices.

The unit cost of energy from Godda was 55% above the average of all Indian power sold to Dhaka, according to the summary of Bangladesh's power purchases.

Bangladesh is pressing for Adani Power to use other benchmarks that would lower the tariff after one of the indices was revised last year, said three BPDB sources.

Adani Power has rejected that, one of them said, adding the two sides were meeting soon.

The agreements stipulate that arbitration be carried out in Singapore, but Khan said Bangladesh's next move depended on the outcome of the court-ordered investigation.

"If it is proven that bribery or irregularities had happened, then we will have to follow the court order if any cancellation happens," he said.



Title: Stocks dive after Fed cuts rates, signals slower easing pace in 2025

The Fed cut rates by 25 basis points to the 4.25%-4.50% range and its summary of economic projections (SEP) indicated it will make rate cuts totaling a half percentage point by the end of 2025

US stocks plunged on Wednesday, with all three major indexes posting their biggest daily decline in months, after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point but disappointed some investors with projections that signaled a more cautious path of easing next year.

The Fed cut rates by 25 basis points to the 4.25%-4.50% range and its summary of economic projections (SEP) indicated it will make rate cuts totaling a half percentage point by the end of 2025 given the solid labour market and the recent stall in lowering inflation.

"If you look at the changes to the statement of economic projection, they really had no choice," said Ellen Hazen, chief market strategist at FL Putnam Investment Management in Wellesley, Massachusetts.

"So as you look at all the changes that they made, it's very clear that the economy is running a lot hotter than their previous projection. And that has got to contribute to their desire to potentially pause."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,123.03 points, or 2.58%, to 42,326.87, the S&P 500 lost 178.45 points, or 2.95%, to 5,872.16 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 716.37 points, or 3.56%, to 19,392.69.

The Dow suffered its 10th straight session of declines, its longest streak of daily losses since an 11-session skid in October 1974.

The Dow and S&P saw their biggest one-day percentage decline since Aug. 5 and the Nasdaq saw its biggest daily decline since July 24.

The small cap Russell 2000 dropped 4.4%, its biggest drop since June 16, 2022. Small cap stocks are seen as more likely to benefit from a lower interest rate environment.

Despite the declines, the Dow is up nearly 12.3% on the year, while the S&P has rallied about 23% and the Nasdaq has shot up more than 29%, lifted largely by technology companies and enthusiasm around artificial intelligence, along with prospects of a lower rate environment and more recently, the hope of deregulation policies from President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration.

However, investors are also wary that some of Trump's expected policies, such as tariffs, could rekindle higher inflation.

The CBOE Volatility Index - an options-based gauge of investor expectations for near-term stock market gyrations - jumped 11.75 points to close at a four-month high of 27.62.

US Treasury yields moved higher after the statement as the benchmark US 10-year note touched its highest level since May 31 at 4.518%.

"You've got the 10-year creeping back up, around that 4.5% and particularly the 5% level that's been a real problem for equity markets," said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird in Louisville, Kentucky.

"Probably the most obvious headwind or point of contention for markets in the first quarter of next year is whether the markets interpret the policies on the table as inflationary and, or, pro-growth, both things are embedded in the 10-year."

Markets were pricing in expectations the Fed will hold rates steady at its January meeting, while factoring in about 33 basis points (bps) in cuts for 2025, down from 49 bps immediately after the Fed statement.

Higher interest rates are usually seen as a drag to the equity market, boosting the appeal of less risky assets while crimping the ability of companies to grow earnings.

Each of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower, with real estate, down 4%, and consumer discretionary leading declines, off 4.7%.

Cryptocurrency related stocks fell, with losses accelerating after Powell said the central bank is not allowed to own bitcoin and is not seeking a law change in order to do so. There has been speculation Trump's incoming administration might seek to build a government owned stock of the asset. Microstrategy tumbled 9.5%, MARA Holdings plunged 12.2% and Riot Platforms fell 14.5%.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9.489-to-1 ratio on the NYSE, and by a 5.46-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P 500 posted six new 52-week highs and 27 new lows, while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 80 new highs and 264 new lows.

Volume on US exchanges was 18.59 billion shares, compared with the 14.36 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.



Title: Business influence on soybean oil prices leaves finance advisor helpless

He calls market conditions complex and difficult to control

Finance Advisor Salehuddin Ahmed has come to realise just how powerful businesses are as he deals with the soybean oil market.

Referring to the insufficient supply of soybean oil in the market despite price increases, he said the market realities are "quite complex" and breaking them is "quite challenging".

A week ago, the price of soybean oil was raised by Tk 8 per litre, bringing the price to Tk 175.

However, there have been continued reports of insufficient supply despite the price increase.

"The problem is that there's a gap between our price determination and the actual market reality. For instance, when the price went up by Tk 8, there was plenty of supply the following day. After the price hike, businesses have expectations that further increases will follow," the advisor told journalists after a meeting of the Advisors Council Committee on Government Purchase at the Secretariat on Wednesday.

He also pointed out the limitations of market monitoring, saying it is impractical for the National Consumer Rights Protection Directorate to monitor every location, citing his visit to Pabna where the situation remained the same.

Salehuddin stressed that if the public becomes more aware and reports complaints, proper action will be taken.

"If anyone charges excessively, consumers should speak out," he said.

Salehuddin added, "People here have a higher tolerance and just buy the goods. But consumers abroad are much more aware and protest when prices rise. I am not asking for protests, but at least for everyone to speak up.”

When asked about the strength of business syndicates, the finance advisor said: “Definitely. It’s not just syndicates; the businesses involved are very powerful. There are large traders, medium-sized ones, and those who import directly and supply goods, as well as those who act as agents, only supplying goods or issuing DOs [Delivery Orders].”

“It’s a complex system, and breaking it is difficult.”

When asked why raids were limited to the retail sector and not extended to wholesalers and mills, the finance advisor explained: “Raiding everywhere at once could worsen the artificial crisis. We aim to balance the market by ensuring businesses can operate while preventing excessive profiteering. At the same time, we want producers to receive fair prices for their costs. Achieving this balance will take time.”



Title: Eastern Bank honours 30 partners at Digital Excellence Summit 2024

The event celebrates the contributions of key partners to the bank’s digital journey

Eastern Bank hounors 30 partners at EBL Digital Excellence Summit 2024 held at BICC on 17 Dec 17, 2024.

Eastern Bank Limited, or EBL, has recognised 30 partner companies for their remarkable contributions to the development of its digital services and solutions.

The awards were presented under three categories—Partners in Progress, Excellence in Business, and Enablers of Excellence—during a gala ceremony at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre, or BICC, in Dhaka on Dec 17.

The ceremony brought together key partners, merchants, and industry leaders to celebrate collective achievements in digital transformation.

The bank’s Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, Ali Reza Iftekhar highlighted the importance of collaboration, saying: “This award reflects our strong commitment to collaboration, innovation, and excellence.”

“Together, we are setting new standards in the digital financial services landscape and paving the way for a more inclusive and prosperous future for Bangladesh.”

M Khorshed Anowar, deputy managing director and head of Retail and SME Banking at EBL, delivered the keynote speech on "Current Scenario of Digital Inclusion in Bangladesh and Future Prospects of Digital Payments."

Ahsan Ullah Chowdhury, head of Digital Financial Services at EBL, offered a vote of thanks.



Title: Soybean oil crisis lingers as rising prices spill over into 'old' bottles

The president of the Edible Oil Wholesalers Association says companies want to make a profit

The supply of soybean oil in Dhaka's retail markets has slightly improved following an official price hike, but it still falls short of meeting demand, sparking objections over the pricing.

Several customers in the capital's Karwan Bazar, Mohakhali, and Niketan kitchen markets alleged that there is a shortage of 1-litre and 2-litre of bottled soybean oil in numerous shops.

They said although the old price is written on the label of the bottle, the extra price is being charged.

The retailers say they are not getting enough oil to keep up with demand, claiming information about many wholesalers who have started stocking oil before Ramadan.

Golam Mawla, president of the Edible Oil Wholesalers Association, told bdnews24.com that the S Alam Group used to supply large quantities of cooking oil to the market; they are closed.

"City Group is facing a shortage and their products are probably on the way. There could be a supply crisis."

Disagreeing with the allegations of stockpiling, he said: "How many thousand tonnes of oil are possible to hoard? Where is such a place to stock bottled oil? It's not a thing. Another reason could be that companies want to make more profit."

On Dec 9, the government increased the price of the product by Tk 8 per litre amid the "disappearance" of soybean oil from all small and big markets for several weeks, citing soaring prices in the global market.

According to the announcement, the maximum retail price of per litre bottled soybean oil has now been fixed at Tk 175, up by Tk 8. The maximum retail price of open soybean and palm oil will be Tk 157; a 5-litre bottle of soybean oil will be available for Tk 852.

On the day of the price hike [Dec 9], Commerce Advisor Sheikh Bashir Uddin said: “We have set a reasonable price after talking to the companies. There won't be any problem."

Since that day, the supply of bottled soybean oil in the capital’s kitchen markets has continued to increase. But “the problem” is still not completely solved.

A person named Hamid Akand went to a few shops in the Mohakhali kitchen market to buy oil on Saturday.

"The supply of oil in the market is still the same as it was before; it is not normal; the crisis remains," he told bdnews24.com.

"Some shops have 2-litre of bottled oil, but not 1-litre. Where there is 1-litre, there is no 5-litre. In some places, open oil is being sold for more than the price fixed by the government."

Salma Begum, a housewife who came to Niketan raw market, also echoes Hamid, saying  "Soybean oil is still not available in the market.”

"The prices of petrol and diesel are much higher than the government fixed rates. I bought open soybean oil for Tk 180 per litre."

Abdur Rahman, another shopper at the market, told bdnews24.com: "I took a 1-litre bottled oil at Tk 175. But Tk 167 is written on the bottle.”

The sellers argue that they have purchased the oil at the new price. That's why they have to keep more.

Mustafa Haider, president of the Bangladesh Edible Oil Association, said: "We have been working for a few days on how to ensure adequate supply in the market."



Title: High court orders two-week status quo on Nagad administrator's activities

The order bars new actions by the administrator and board until Jan 2

The High Court has ordered a two-week status quo on the activities of the administrator appointed to the mobile financial service provider “Nagad”.

The bench of Justice Farah Mahbub and Justice Debashish Roy Chowdhury issued the order on Wednesday, following a plea filed by the company’s Executive Director Md Shafayet Alam.

Lawyers Md Naushad Zamir and Abul Kalam Khan Daud represented the petitioner, while lawyer Saiful Islam appeared for Bangladesh Bank.

The order restricts the administrator and the board from initiating any new actions beyond regular business operations until Jan 2, lawyer Kalam told bdnews24.com.

He added that the High Court will deliver its final verdict after a hearing scheduled for Jan 2.

Following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina regime on Aug 5, a series of changes were made in the management of several government and private institutions.

On Aug 18, Bangladesh Bank appointed Badiuzzaman Didar, a director from its Chattogram office, as the administrator of Nagad for one year, with additional staff to assist him.

The previous board of directors of Nagad was also dissolved on the same day.

The petition filed by Shafayet challenges the administrator's appointment, naming the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications secretary, Bangladesh Bank governor, Payment Systems Department director, Directorate of Posts director general, and Badiuzzaman as respondents.

On Sept 17, after preliminary hearings, the High Court bench issued a rule questioning why the appointment of the Bangladesh Bank administrator at Nagad should not be declared illegal and unlawful.

Nagad, which started as a mobile financial service provider, was later granted a digital bank licence.

The decision to appoint an administrator came shortly after a request for detailed information regarding the five foreign investors in Nagad's digital bank.



Title: Honda and Nissan consider mutual production of vehicles, Kyodo reports

Honda will consider supplying hybrid vehicles to Nissan as part of a plan, report says

Honda 7267.T and Nissan 7201.T are considering producing vehicles in one another's factories as part of their plan to deepen ties and potentially merge, Japan's Kyodo news agency said on Saturday.

Honda will consider supplying hybrid vehicles to Nissan as part of the plan, the report said, without citing the source of the information.

A merger of Honda, Japan's second-largest car company, and Nissan, its third-largest, would create the world's third-largest auto group by vehicle sales, behind Toyota 7203.T and Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, making 7.4 million vehicles a year.

The two automakers forged a strategic partnership in March to cooperate in electric vehicle development, but Nissan has faced financial and strategic troubles in recent months.

As announced, Honda, "Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors are in the process of bringing together our strengths and exploring potential forms of cooperation, but nothing has been decided yet", a Honda spokesperson said, when asked about the report.

Nissan declined to comment, saying the details of the report were not based on a company announcement. Nissan is the top shareholder in Mitsubishi Motors 7211.T.

Kyodo said Honda could use Nissan's car factory in Britain, as it now only has factories for engines and motorcycles in Europe.

The move comes amid concerns over how president-elect Donald Trump's policies may shake up manufacturing with his promises of protectionist trade policies, the report said.



Title: Starbucks workers' union strikes across US as talks hit impasse

Workers demand better pay, more staff, better schedules, the union says adding the strike could reach 'hundreds of stores' by Dec 24

Some members of the Starbucks workers' union that represents more than 10,000 baristas walked off their jobs in multiple US cities on Friday, citing unresolved issues over wages, staffing and schedules.

The five-day strike, which began on Friday and closed Starbucks cafes in Los Angeles, Chicago and Seattle, will expand to Columbus, Denver, and Pittsburgh through Saturday, the union said in a statement.

This is the latest in a series of labour actions that have picked up pace across service industries following a period when workers at manufacturers in the automotive, aerospace and rail industries won substantial concessions from employers.

At Starbucks, the Workers United union, which represents employees at 525 stores across the US, said late on Thursday that walkouts would escalate daily, and could reach "hundreds of stores" nationwide by Christmas Eve.

"It's estimated that 10 stores out of 10,000 company-operated stores did not open today," Starbucks said, adding that there was no significant impact to store operations on Friday.

Around 20 people joined a picket line at a Starbucks location on Chicago's north side, buffeted by snow and wind, but cheering in response to the honking horns of passing cars.

A few confused customers tried to walk into the closed store before strikers began chanting, but union member Shep Searl said the reaction had been mostly positive.

Searl said 100% of the unionized workers at the Starbucks location in Chicago's Edgewater neighborhood were participating in the strike, and according to the workers, they have been subject to numerous unfair labor practices including write-ups, "captive-audience" meetings and firings.

The union member said they made about $21 an hour and added, "that would have been a great wage in 2013".

It is an inadequate wage, the baristas said, given inflation and the high cost of living in a large city, especially since they rarely get 40-hour work weeks.

WORKERS SNUB OFFER

Negotiations between the company and Workers United began in April, based on an established framework agreed upon in February, which could also help resolve numerous pending legal disputes.

The company said on Thursday it has held more than nine bargaining sessions with the union since April, and reached more than 30 agreements on "hundreds of topics", including economic issues.

The Seattle-headquartered firm said it is ready to continue negotiations, claiming the union delegates prematurely ended the bargaining session this week.

The union, however, said in a Facebook post on Friday that Starbucks had yet to present a serious economic proposal with less than two weeks remaining until the year-end contract deadline.

The workers' group also snubbed an offer of no immediate wage hike and a guarantee of a 1.5% increase in future years.

"Workers United proposals call for an immediate increase in the minimum wage of hourly partners by 64%, and by 77% over the life of a three-year contract. This is not sustainable," Starbucks said on Friday.

In response to Starbucks' statement on the proposals, Michelle Eisen, a Starbucks barista and bargaining delegate, said, "Starbucks' characterization of our proposals is misleading and they know it. We are ready to finalise a framework that includes new investments in baristas in the first year of contracts".

Separately, the baristas' union said on Friday that it filed a new labour practice charge against the coffee house, alleging Starbucks "refused to bargain and engaged in bad faith bargaining" over economic issues.

Hundreds of complaints have been filed with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), accusing Starbucks of unlawful labour practices such as firing union supporters and closing stores during labour campaigns. Starbucks has denied wrongdoing and said it respects the right of workers to choose whether to unionise.

WORKING ON A TURNAROUND

Last month, the NLRB said that Starbucks broke the law by telling workers at its flagship Seattle cafe that they would lose benefits if they joined a union.

"It's (the strike) taking place during one of the busiest times of the year for Starbucks, which could magnify its impact while bringing unwanted public scrutiny into the company's labour practices," Emarketer analyst Rachel Wolff said.

The coffee chain is working on a turnaround under its newly appointed top boss, Brian Niccol, who aims to restore "coffee house culture" by overhauling cafes and simplifying its menu among other measures.

"Given how much Starbucks is already struggling to win over customers, it can ill afford any negative publicity - or impact to sales - that the strike could bring," Wolff said.

The Starbucks workers' strike comes in the same week as Amazon.com workers at seven US facilities walking off the job on Thursday, during the holiday shopping rush.

There were 33 work stoppages in 2023, the most since 2000, though far lower than in past decades, data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics showed.



Title: Bangladeshi expats send over $2 billion remittance in three weeks of December

It marks five consecutive months with over $2 billion in remittances

In the first 21 days of December 2024, expatriates have sent nearly $2.07 billion in remittances to their families and beneficiaries.

In contrast, $1.72 billion was received in the first 23 days of November.

Throughout the entire month of November, $2.19 billion in remittances came through banking channels.

On Sunday, Bangladesh Bank released an updated report revealing that remittances exceeded $2 billion in three weeks, marking five consecutive months with over $2 billion in remittances.

Since April this year, expatriates have been sending more than $2 billion each month, with the exception of July when the figure dipped below this threshold.

Commenting on the upward trend, Syed Mahbubur Rahman, managing director of Mutual Trust Bank, told bdnews24.com: "The remittance rate through banking channels has increased from before, which is why more remittances are coming."

In addition to a 2.5 percent incentive, expatriates are receiving over Tk120 per dollar when sending money through banks. Bankers believe this has significantly boosted remittances through banking channels.

In May of this year, the central bank introduced the "crawling peg" system to determine the dollar exchange rate, causing the dollar rate to jump from Tk 110 to 117. Later, the remittance rate through banking channels was set at Tk 120 per dollar.

Thanks to the positive trend in remittances, $11.11 billion was received during the five months from July to November of the current 2024–25 fiscal year.

This marks a 26.40 percent increase compared with $8.79 billion during the same period in the previous fiscal year.



Title: WB, ADB to give $1.1bn in support for Yunus govt

The interim government hopes the funds will be made available to them in December

The Ministry of Finance says that the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have approved $1.1 billion in budget support for the interim government led by Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus.

The government hopes the funds will be made available this December.

The WB has approved two budget support funds amounting to $500 million and the ADB has approved $600 million in support to accelerate the interim government’s reform and development activities.

In addition to the budget support, the WB has also approved $379 million for the health and nutrition sector and $280 million in project support for developing the water supply system in Chattogram.

On Dec 18, a loan agreement of $600 million was signed between the Bangladesh government and the ADP for the programme titled “Strengthening Economic Management and Governance Program”. The programme was formulated under an initiative by the Finance Division.

On Dec 19, the WB approved $500 million in budget support for Bangladesh. It is providing the funds under the “Second Bangladesh Green and Climate Resilient Development Credit”, which aims to support reforms to help the country's transition to green and climate-resilient development.



Title: Inflation figures are not manipulated, reflect reality: Finance Advisor Salehuddin

The finance advisor dismisses claims of manipulation, clarifies the causes behind rising inflation rates

Finance Advisor Salehuddin Ahmed has clarified that the rising inflation rate is a true reflection of the economy, rejecting claims of manipulation.

He explained that the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, or BBS, was instructed to release the data that was available, with no attempt to hide information.

Speaking at the launch of the sixth edition of the Banking Almanac at Dhaka's CIRDAP auditorium on Saturday, Salehuddin acknowledged past discrepancies in data related to inflation and gross domestic product, or GDP, attributing them to both unintentional mistakes and attempts by policymakers to conceal information.

Despite multiple interest rate hikes, inflation has continued to rise in Bangladesh, hitting 11.38 percent in November, up from 10.87 percent in the previous month.

This means that a basket of goods and services that cost Tk 100 in November 2023 would cost Tk 111.38 in November 2024.

The finance advisor said that the interim government is not here to show off its capacity, but to address discrepancies in the last 15 years of data.

He said efforts are underway to correct and revise this information, which was previously concealed.

He also said donor organisations have raised questions about the issue, but the interim government have clarifying that the earlier data was hidden and that they are now presenting the correct figures.

The advisor also highlighted issues in the capital markets, criticising investors for buying worthless "Z-category" shares with no real value, warning that these will soon become worthless.

He urged investors to be cautious and criticised market players and regulators for their roles in the ongoing issues.



Title: Reserves reach $20 billion as Bangladesh Bank buys dollars to meet IMF conditions

Bangladesh Bank aims for $15.30 billion in net reserves by December end

Foreign exchange reserves have risen sharply within a week as the central bank purchased dollars from commercial banks to meet the International Monetary Fund, or IMF, conditions.

Bangladesh Bank said foreign exchange reserves stood at $19.95 billion under the BPM-6 method, up from $19.20 billion on Dec 11—an increase of $753 million in a week.

A senior central bank official told bdnews24.com: “Bangladesh Bank wants to increase its net reserves to $15.30 billion by the end of December in compliance with the IMF conditions.

“That is why it is buying from commercial banks instead of selling dollars.”

When asked if the reserves were rising due to dollar purchases, Bangladesh Bank Executive Director and Spokesperson Husne Ara Shikha told bdnews24.com: “I will not explain how the reserves are increasing.”

The central bank's dollar purchases have caused the value of the US currency to rise against the taka.

On Wednesday, some private banks bought remittances at Tk 126.50 to Tk 127, up from Tk 120 a month earlier, while money exchanges sold dollars at even higher rates.

Another official said: “Many banks are selling dollars to the central bank instead of the interbank market, and foreign exchange houses are also selling dollars to banks at higher rates.”

Last month, the reserves fell to $18 billion due to the payment of import liabilities through the Asian Clearing Union, or ACU.

As remittances and export earnings flowed in, reserves rose, though they remained below levels seen when the Sheikh Hasina government fell in August.

Bangladesh Bank reported $20.48 billion in reserves on Jul 30, a figure that remained unchanged on Aug 21.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, reserves peaked at a record $48 billion.

However, rising global fuel and food prices, coupled with the Ukraine war, drove up import costs, leading to a steady decline in reserves since 2022.

In the past two fiscal years, Bangladesh Bank sold dollars from reserves to facilitate government Letters of Credit, or LCs, for commercial banks, further depleting foreign exchange reserves.

Following Hasina’s departure, Ahsan H Mansur assumed the role of Bangladesh Bank governor.

At a press conference, he announced a halt to dollar sales from reserves, saying this would boost reserves and eliminate the risk of further decline.

However, reserves have yet to cross the $20 billion mark even after four months, despite repeated assurances from Bangladesh Bank about their growth.



Title: Fourth tranche of IMF loan may arrive in February

The overall picture of Bangladesh's economy is still not very promising, the IMF delegation says

The International Monetary Fund, or IMF, will release the fourth tranche of its ongoing loan programme, amounting to $645 million, following the approval the executive board at a meeting in February.

Chris Papageorgiou, chief of the Development Macroeconomics Division in the Research Department of the IMF, made the announcement at a press conference at the finance ministry on Thursday.

Before the release of the fourth instalment, a 13-strong delegation came to review the progress of the reform proposals made by the IMF on Bangladesh’s economy.

Before returning, they held a press conference at the ministry.

Regarding the release of the money, the head of the IMF delegation said the proposal for the release of the tranche will be raised at the IMF Executive Board meeting on Feb 5. It will be distributed once it is approved.

Papageorgiou said, “The overall picture of Bangladesh's economy is still not very promising. Inflation remains out of control for a long time. The current inflation rate of 9.6 percent is much higher than the IMF's estimate. Bangladesh Bank will have to play a more active role in controlling the crisis.”

He said the IMF is positive about providing assistance to Bangladesh. However, the growth of domestic income and the reform of the banking sector must continue.

Regarding the printing of new currency notes, he said: “The printing of new money is also a matter of concern. It may bring a temporary relief, but not for a long time.”



Title: Bangladesh Bank looks at 'new mechanism' as dollar rates crawl up

"We didn't expect dollar prices to increase this much. It rose to Tk 127-128. Besides, Bangladesh Bank isn't selling dollars," says the managing director of Citizens Bank

As the demand in the import sector jumps ahead of Ramadan and the central bank preparing to boost its reserves, the price of the dollar has gone up.

Although Bangladesh Bank fixed the exchange rate at Tk 120, some private banks bought remittances at Tk 126.50 to Tk 127 on Tuesday. The money changing houses also sold dollars at a raised rate.

In consideration of the overall situation, Bangladesh Bank is pondering launching a 'new mechanism,' said its spokesperson Executive Director Husne Ara Shikha. A circular will be issued in this regard on Thursday, she said.

Demand for imports have surged as Ramadan looms in March. On the other hand, Bangladesh Bank aims to push net reserves up to $15.30 billion at the end of December to meet the condition imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). As such, instead of selling, the central bank is purchasing dollars from the commercial banks. Under the circumstances, inflation, which was already increased in November, may increase further due to a hike in import prices.

"Dollar prices went up mainly because of the increased demand in the import business," said BB spokesperson Shikha.

There are a few reasons behind the exchange rate hike, a senior official at the central bank told bdnews24.com. "Mainly, the banks are increasing imports with the coming of Ramadan. This has pushed up the demand for dollars. However, the remittance and export flow is not enough to match the import demand," he explained.

Moreover, the central bank is purchasing dollars from commercial banks to increase its foreign currency reserves. Hence, many banks are selling dollars to Bangladesh Bank, instead of selling at the interbank level. "The foreign exchange houses are also selling dollars at an increased rate."

Banks purchase dollars from two sources - remitters and exporters, said the treasury head of a private bank.

The dollars bought from the exporters usually cost Tk 119 to Tk 120, while remittances are purchased at a slightly higher price. The authorities open LCs using an average of these two prices.

"Bangladesh Bank usually sells dollars to other banks, which it has halted for now. Instead, it is buying dollars from the banks to increase the reserves. Also, more LCs are opened before Ramadan. Hence, the banks need more dollars," the treasury head added.

"We didn't expect dollar prices to increase this much. It rose to Tk 127-128. Besides, Bangladesh Bank isn't selling dollars," said the managing director of Citizens Bank Mohammad Masum.

Masum said that one of the reasons behind the price hike was the surging demand for opening LCs in the import business. "On the other side, the IMF imposed a condition that the reserves shouldn't drop. Which means that the net reserve level should be maintained."

"If a bank buys remittances at a higher rate, it can't sell dollars at a lower rate. Nobody runs their business for losses. As per the law, you can't face financial loss in a foreign exchange business. This is an offence as per the banking law. Hence, the price is surging as the supply isn't sufficient," said a deputy managing director of a bank on condition of anonymity.

Inflation may rise further in mid-December with the rising exchange rate and hike in import costs. According to the updated information of the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), inflation stood at 11.38 percent in November. The figure was 10.87 percent the month before.

Bangladesh Bank introduced a ‘crawling peg,’ system for the exchange rate in May this year. This resulted in the rate jumping by Tk 7 and reached Tk 117. Then the rate was fixed at Tk 120 using the ‘crawling peg,’ system. Now Bangladesh Bank is looking into new options to address the exchange rate hike.
