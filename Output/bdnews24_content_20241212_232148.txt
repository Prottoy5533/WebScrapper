President-elect Donald Trump is now considering tapping Richard Grenell, his former intelligence chief, to be a special envoy for Iran, according to two people familiar with the transition plans.

&quot;He&#39;s definitely in the running,&quot; said a person familiar with transition deliberations, who asked not to be identified.

No final decisions on either personnel or strategy on Iran have been made official yet by Trump, including whether to slap fresh sanctions on the country, pursue diplomacy or both in order to halt their nuclear program.

Trump&#39;s plans for the role have not previously been reported. Neither Trump&#39;s team nor Grenell responded to requests for comment.

&quot;Richard Grenell is a fabulous person, A STAR. He will be someplace, high up!&quot; Trump said in a post on his social media platform late Wednesday following the Reuters report.

Grenell, in a separate post on X, called the report &quot;wrong&quot; but gave no other details.

Still, Trump&#39;s consideration of a key ally for such a posting sends a signal to the region that the new US president may be open to talks with a country he has previously threatened and whose elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps have sought to assassinate him, according to the US government. Iran has denied the claim.

In the role, Grenell is expected to be tasked with speaking with countries in and beyond the region about the Iran issue as well as taking Tehran&#39;s temperature on possible negotiations, said one of the people.

Iran&#39;s President Masoud Pezeshkian, who is viewed as relatively moderate, said following Trump&#39;s election that Tehran must &quot;deal with the US&quot; and &quot;manage&quot; relations with its arch-foe.

Iran has suffered a series of strategic setbacks, including Israel&#39;s assault on Tehran&#39;s proxy militias Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon and the ouster of Iranian ally Bashar al-Assad in Syria.

But tensions remain high more than a year after Hamas attacked southern Israel, launching the Gaza war. Meanwhile, other Iranian proxies have attacked US, Israeli and other Western targets, and Tehran has accelerated its nuclear program while limiting the UN nuclear watchdog&#39;s ability to monitor it.

It&#39;s not the first job Trump has considered for Grenell, who served as Trump&#39;s ambassador to Germany, a special presidential envoy for Serbia and Kosovo peace negotiations, and as acting director of national intelligence during Trump&#39;s 2017-2021 term.

After campaigning for Trump in the lead up to the Nov 5 election, he was a top contender to be secretary of state and for special envoy for the Ukraine war. Those jobs went to US Senator Marco Rubio and retired lieutenant general Keith Kellogg, respectively. Trump takes office next month.

During his first term in office, in 2020, Trump ordered a US air strike that killed Iran&#39;s top military commander, Qassem Soleimani.

Trump in 2018 also reneged on a nuclear deal struck by his predecessor Barack Obama in 2015 and re-imposed US economic sanctions on Iran that had been relaxed. The deal had limited Iran&#39;s ability to enrich uranium, a process that can yield fissile material for nuclear weapons.

Iran now is &quot;dramatically&quot; accelerating enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% level that is weapons grade, the UN nuclear watchdog chief told Reuters last week. Iran says its nuclear program only serves peaceful purposes.

Two senior members of Taiwan&#39;s government are in the United States to meet people connected to President-elect Donald Trump&#39;s transition team, five sources told Reuters, in an effort by Taiwan to establish ties with the incoming administration.

Lin Fei-fan and Hsu Szu-chien, both deputy secretaries-general of Taiwan&#39;s National Security Council and several of their staff have travelled to the Washington area for meetings through this week, the sources said on condition of anonymity.

Reuters was not able to confirm who from the US side would join the meetings or the agenda.

Taiwan&#39;s de facto embassy in Washington, China&#39;s embassy and the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment.

The visit by Lin and Hsu comes as China&#39;s military has stepped up activity near the Taiwan Strait, in what Taiwan has said is Beijing&#39;s effort to set a &quot;red line&quot; for the incoming Trump administration and US allies.

One of the sources said the meetings were with individuals in Trump transition circles but would not include nominees for top positions in Trump&#39;s next administration, given sensitivity in Beijing over any talks between Taiwanese and US officials.

The meetings are with &quot;Republicans likely to populate mid-tier political positions&quot; in the Trump administration, a second source said. A third source said it was &quot;safe to say&quot; Lin and Hsu were meeting the Trump transition team.

A fourth source added that visits to the United States at such a level are not rare and that they are to meet &quot;old friends&quot;, including people in Trump&#39;s circle.

The United States does not have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, a democratically governed island that China claims as its own territory. Taiwan rejects Beijing&#39;s sovereignty claims, saying only the island&#39;s people can decide their future.

HOPE AND WORRY IN TAIWAN

Trump&#39;s electoral win in November has sparked hope in Taipei that he will pursue a tough line with China but also anxiety given his comments that the island should pay the US for its defence.

Trump has named numerous China hawks to key posts in his incoming administration, including Senator Marco Rubio as Secretary of State, who has called for unfettered interaction between US and Taiwan officials.

Those nominations have been encouraging for Taipei, which Reuters has reported may place large new arms deals to show it takes seriously Trump&#39;s statements that Taiwan should pay &quot;protection&quot; money to the United States.

Engagement to date between Taiwan and the incoming administration appears to fall in a gray area of unofficial contact and has been low-key. That&#39;s a departure from the period before Trump&#39;s first term, when in December 2016, the month before his inauguration, he held a phone call with then-Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen.

That call marked the first time since 1979 that a US president-elect had spoken with the island&#39;s president, a move that angered China.

Ahead of his second inauguration, scheduled for Jan 20, CBS News reported on Wednesday that Trump had invited Xi to attend the event, something that would be unprecedented for a Chinese leader.

The president-elect&#39;s camp and China did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report, but Trump said in an interview with NBC News conducted last Friday that he &quot;got along with very well&quot; with Xi and that they had &quot;had communication as recently as this week.&quot;

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Thursday lashed out at his political opponents as &quot;anti-state forces&quot;, said North Korea has hacked the country&#39;s elections and defended his short-lived martial law order as a legal move to protect democracy.

His comments on Thursday came as the leader of Yoon&#39;s own party said the president had shown no signs of resigning and must be impeached.

He faces a second impeachment vote in parliament expected on Saturday, a week after the first one failed because most of the ruling party boycotted the vote.

&quot;I will fight to the end,&quot; he said near the end of a lengthy address broadcast on television.

Yoon is under criminal investigation for alleged insurrection over the botched Dec 3 martial law declaration, which sparked the biggest political crisis in South Korea in decades.

Lawmakers broke through a police cordon, some by scaling the fence, to enter parliament and demand Yoon to rescind martial law within hours of the declaration.

In comments that echoed his justification for declaring emergency rule in the first place, he said the &quot;criminal groups&quot; that have paralysed state affairs and disrupted the rule of law must be stopped at all cost from taking over government.

Yoon said the country&#39;s National Election Commission was hacked by North Korea last year but the independent agency refused to cooperate in an investigation and inspection of its system to safeguard integrity.

He said the refusal was enough to raise questions about the integrity of the April 2024 election and led him to declare martial law.

Yoon&#39;s People Power Party (PPP) suffered a crushing defeat in the April election, allowing the Democratic Party overwhelming control of the single-chamber assembly. Even so, the opposition needs eight members of the PPP to vote with them for the president to be impeached

Just before Yoon&#39;s televised address, PPP leader Han Dong-hoon said Yoon had to be stripped of power and the only way to accomplish that is for the party to back the impeachment bill.

US President-elect Donald Trump has invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to attend his inauguration next month, CBS News reported on Wednesday, citing multiple sources.

The invitation to the Jan. 20 inauguration in Washington occurred in early November, shortly after the Nov. 5 presidential election, and it was not clear if it had been accepted, CBS reported.

The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump said in an interview with NBC News conducted on Friday that he &quot;got along with very well&quot; with Xi and that they had &quot;had communication as recently as this week.&quot;

It would be unprecedented for a leader of China, a top US geopolitical rival, to attend a US presidential inauguration.

Trump has named numerous China hawks to key posts in his incoming administration, including Senator Marco Rubio as secretary of state.

The president-elect has said he will impose an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods unless Beijing does more to stop trafficking of the highly addictive narcotic fentanyl. He also threatened tariffs in excess of 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.

In late November, China&#39;s state media warned Trump that his pledge to slap additional tariffs on Chinese goods over fentanyl flows could drag the world&#39;s top two economies into a mutually destructive tariff war.

Separately on Wednesday, China&#39;s US Ambassador Xie Feng read a letter from Xi to a US-China Business Council gala in Washington, in which the Chinese leader said Beijing was prepared to stay in communication with the US

&quot;We should choose dialogue over confrontation and win-win cooperation over zero-sum games,&quot; Xi said in the letter.

Xie added that the two countries should not decouple supply chains. But Nicholas Burns, the US ambassador to Beijing, said in a pre-recorded video address that China at times tried to &quot;sugar coat&quot; challenging and competitive relations.

&quot;No amount of happy talk can obscure our profound differences,&quot; Burns said.

Israelis and Palestinians are signaling new efforts to forge a ceasefire deal, even a limited one, for the first time in a year that would pause the fighting in Gaza and return to Israel some of the hostages still held in the Palestinian enclave.

Israel Defence Minister Israel Katz told his US counterpart Lloyd Austin in a phone call on Wednesday there was now a chance for a new deal that would allow the return of all the hostages, including US citizens, Katz&#39;s office said.

A Western diplomat in the region, however, said a deal was taking shape, but it would likely be limited in scope, involving the release of only a handful of hostages and a short pause in hostilities.

Such a truce and release would be only the second since the start of the war in October 2023.

The guarded optimism emerges as US President Joe Biden&#39;s national security adviser Jake Sullivan heads to Israel for talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday and then to Egypt and Qatar, co-mediators with the US on a deal.

Separately, President-elect Donald Trump has demanded that militants of the Palestinian Hamas group release the hostages held in Gaza before he takes over from Biden on Jan. 20. Otherwise, Trump has said, there will be &ldquo;hell to pay.&rdquo;

Trump&#39;s designated hostage envoy Adam Boehler has said he too is involved, having spoken already to Biden and to Netanyahu. Israel says 100 hostages remain captive in Gaza. Seven are believed to be US citizens.

Citing Trump&#39;s threat of &quot;hell to pay,&quot; Boehler told Israel&#39;s Channel 13 news last week: &quot;I would appeal to those people that have taken hostages: Make your best deal now. Make it now because every day that passes, it is going to get harder and harder and more Hamas lives will be lost.&quot;

Although Biden and Trump are working separately, their efforts overlap and both stand to gain from a deal. A US official said Trump&#39;s public statements about the need for a swift ceasefire &ldquo;have not been harmful.&rdquo;

The official said the priority is to get the hostages home, whether it is at the end of the Biden term or the start of the Trump term.

Steve Witkoff, Trump&#39;s designated Middle East envoy, met separately in late November with Netanyahu and Qatar&#39;s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said a source briefed on the talks.

TIMING IS APT FOR NETANYAHU

The timing for a deal may never have been better politically for Netanyahu.

The prime minister told reporters on Monday that Hamas&#39; increasing isolation following the collapse of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad&#39;s rule opened the door to a possible hostage deal even if it was too early to claim success.

Israel&#39;s military chief and the head of the Shin Bet internal security service were in Cairo on Tuesday to discuss post-war Gaza border crossings and administration, according to three Israeli security sources.

The public optimism of Israeli leaders over the past week has matched the general tone in internal discussions behind closed doors, according to an Israeli official.

For Netanyahu, concessions would be far easier now with Israel having reestablished its reputation as the most powerful Middle East force and its Iran-backed enemies in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria now posing less of a threat.

Netanyahu&#39;s once-fragile coalition has been strengthened by the addition of Foreign Minister Gideon Saar and his more centrist faction. Netanyahu, having achieved a ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon, can complete the picture with the return of the hostages in a deal with Hamas.

Over the past year, some of the far-right ministers in his cabinet had voiced objections, even threatening to bring down the government, should the war in Gaza end. But with Israel&#39;s enemies weakened, and his coalition strengthened, Netanyahu is far less vulnerable politically.

Saar said on Monday that Israel was now more optimistic about a possible hostage deal amid reports Hamas had asked other Gaza factions to help it compile a list of Israeli and foreign hostages in their custody, whether dead or alive.

A Palestinian official close to the talks and familiar with the positions of all the parties involved described what he called &quot;a fever of negotiations&quot; with ideas emerging on all sides, including among mediators in Egypt and Qatar.

Trump&#39;s involvement had given the talks a boost, even if the sides have yet to present lists of Palestinian prisoners and hostages to be exchanged or to complete plans for a temporary or phased truce, the Palestinian official said.

He said Hamas was willing to show some flexibility should there be guarantees Israel would not resume the fighting.

It is unclear how the sides can bridge the largest gap that has persisted through numerous rounds of failed negotiations; Hamas demands an end to the war, while Israel says the war will not end before Hamas no longer rules Gaza.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken headed to Jordan and Turkey on Wednesday for talks on Syria, the State Department said. Israel is not in his official itinerary but there is always a possibility he might add the stop.

The United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly voted on Wednesday to demand an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas in the Gaza Strip and the immediate release of all hostages.

The ceasefire demand in the resolution - adopted with 158 votes in favour in the 193-member assembly - was expressed in more urgent language than one urging an immediate humanitarian truce in Gaza that the body &quot;called for&quot; in October 2023 then &quot;demanded&quot; in December 2023.

General Assembly resolutions are not binding but carry political weight, reflecting a global view on the war. The United States, Israel and seven other countries voted against the ceasefire resolution, while 13 countries abstained.

The world body also threw its support behind the UN Palestinian relief agency UNRWA, adopting a second resolution with 159 votes in favour to deplore a new Israeli law that will ban UNRWA&#39;s operations in Israel from late January.

It demanded that Israel respect UNRWA&#39;s mandate and &quot;enable its operations to proceed without impediment or restriction.&quot; The US, Israel and seven other countries voted no, while 11 countries abstained.

&quot;The messages we send to the world through these resolutions matter. And both of these resolutions have significant problems,&quot; Deputy US Ambassador to the UN Robert Wood told the assembly.

&quot;One rewards Hamas and downplays the need to release the hostages, and the other denigrates Israel without providing a path forward to increasing humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians,&quot; he said.

Israel&#39;s UN Ambassador Danny Danon last week accused the UN of having &quot;an obsession with vilifying Israel,&quot; while Palestinian UN envoy Riyad Mansour described Gaza as the &quot;open, painful wound for the human family.&quot;

&#39;HUNGER, DESPAIR, DEATH&#39;

Israel says UNRWA staff took part in the Oct 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, which sparked the war in Gaza. The UN has said nine UNRWA staff may have been involved and had been fired. A Hamas commander in Lebanon - killed by Israel - was also found to have had an UNRWA job.

&quot;By voting for these resolutions, you are not voting to protect humanitarian values, but to protect an organization that has become a haven for terror,&quot; Danon told the assembly on Wednesday before the vote.

UNRWA was established by the General Assembly in 1949 following the war surrounding the founding of Israel. The UN has repeatedly said there is no alternative to UNRWA, which provides aid, health and education to millions of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.

&quot;Gaza doesn&#39;t exist anymore. It is destroyed. Palestinians are facing hunger, despair and death,&quot; Slovenia&#39;s UN Ambassador Samuel Zbogar told the assembly. &quot;There is no reason for this war to continue. We need a ceasefire now. We need to bring hostages home now.&quot;

The war in the Palestinian enclave began after Hamas gunmen on Oct 7, 2023, stormed into Israeli communities, killing around 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages back to Hamas-run Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.

Since then, Israel&#39;s military has levelled swathes of Gaza, driving nearly all of its 2.3 million people from their homes, giving rise to deadly hunger and disease and killing more than 44,800 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, who do not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants.

The main commander of the fighters who toppled Bashar al-Assad said on Wednesday that he would dissolve the security forces of the former regime, close its prisons and hunt down anyone involved in the torture or killing of detainees.

Syrian rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa - better known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani - said in a statement to Reuters he will &quot;dissolve the security forces of the previous regime and close the notorious prisons.&quot;

Syria ran one of the most oppressive police states in the Middle East during five decades of Assad family rule. Sharaa, whose former al Qaeda affiliate Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) is now the country&#39;s most powerful force, must balance demands for justice from victims with the need to prevent violent reprisals and secure international aid.

Syrians have flocked to the infamous prisons where the Assad regime is estimated to have held tens of thousands of detainees, desperately looking for their loved ones. Some have been released alive, others were identified among the dead and thousands more have not yet been found.

Sharaa said in a separate statement on the Syrian state TV&#39;s Telegram channel that people who took part in the torture or killing of detainees would be hunted down, and pardons were out of the question.

&quot;We will pursue them in Syria, and we ask countries to hand over those who fled so we can achieve justice,&quot; said Sharaa.

The world is carefully watching to see if Syria&#39;s new rulers can stabilise the country and avoid unleashing violent revenge, after a 13-year civil war fought along sectarian and ethnic lines.

Since Assad&#39;s fall, 27-year-old Hayat al-Turki has been searching the abandoned cells of Syria&#39;s most notorious prison, the vast Sednaya complex, for any sign of her missing relatives, including her brother who vanished 14 years ago.

&quot;I was hopeful and optimistic to find someone from my missing prisoners - a brother, an uncle or a cousin - but I did not... I searched the whole prison,&quot; she said.

Mohammad al-Bashir, the man installed by Sharaa&#39;s fighters to lead an interim administration until March, said he aimed to bring back millions of refugees, create unity and provide basic services.

But the new administration has scant resources, he told Italian newspaper Il Corriere della Sera.

&quot;We have no foreign currency and as for loans and bonds we are still collecting data. So yes, financially we are very bad,&quot; said Bashir, who previously ran a small rebel-led administration in a pocket of northwestern Syria.

Rebuilding Syria is a colossal task following the civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of people, reduced cities to ruins and left the economy gutted by international sanctions. Millions of refugees still live in camps after one of the biggest displacements of modern times.

ENGAGING WARILY

Foreign officials are warily engaging with the former rebels, although HTS remains designated a terrorist organisation by Washington, the United Nations, EU and others.

The new government must &quot;uphold clear commitments to fully respect the rights of minorities, facilitate the flow of humanitarian assistance to all in need, prevent Syria from being used as a base for terrorism or posing a threat to its neighbours,&quot; US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.

US Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer told Reuters Washington remains cautious.

&quot;We have seen over the years any number of militant groups who have ... promised that they would govern in an inclusive way, and then see them fail to meet those promises,&quot; State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.

In addition to terrorism bans in place against the former rebels, Syria also remains under US, European and other financial sanctions imposed against Damascus under Assad.

Two senior US congressmen, a Republican and a Democrat, wrote a letter calling for Washington to suspend some sanctions. The most punishing war-time US sanctions are up for renewal this month, and the former rebels have told Reuters they are in touch with Washington about potentially easing them.

Spain&#39;s Foreign Minister Jose Luis Albares on Wednesday said at the Reuters NEXT conference that he expected the UN and European Union to discuss easing sanctions and removing HTS from lists of terrorist organisations.

The international community must quickly demand that the rebel forces transform into a political movement and respect human rights, he added.

&quot;We must move very fast because in a month, probably, decisions will have already been taken in Damascus and we will not be able to have the impact that we can have today,&quot; Albares said.

With the administration of US President Joe Biden entering its final weeks in office, Blinken and US national security adviser Jake Sullivan headed to the Middle East on Wednesday to work on a Gaza ceasefire and help ensure a smooth transition in Syria, US officials said. Their separate itineraries include stops in Jordan, Turkey, Israel, Qatar and Egypt.

For refugees, the prospect of returning home has brought a mixture of joy and grief over hardship in exile. Syrians lined up at the Turkish border on Wednesday to head home, speaking of their expectations for a better life following what was for many a decade of hardship in Turkey.

&quot;We have no one here. We are going back to Latakia, where we have family,&quot; said Mustafa as he prepared to enter Syria with his wife and three sons at the Cilvegozu border gate in southern Turkey. Dozens more Syrians were waiting to cross.

FBI Director Chris Wray will step down from his post early next year, the bureau said on Wednesday, after Republican President-elect Donald Trump signaled his intent to fire the veteran official and replace him with firebrand Kash Patel.

Trump himself had appointed Wray, a fellow Republican, to his 10-year term in 2017, after firing his predecessor James Comey, who the then-president soured on over the FBI&#39;s investigations into alleged contacts between his 2016 campaign and Russia.

&quot;After weeks of careful thought, I&rsquo;ve decided the right thing for the Bureau is for me to serve until the end of the current Administration in January and then step down,&quot; Wray told FBI employees today, the agency said in a statement.

In a statement to Reuters, Patel said he looks forward to a &quot;smooth transition.&quot;

&quot;I will be ready to serve the American people on day one,&quot; he said.

Trump and his hardline allies turned on Wray, and the FBI more generally, after agents conducted a court-approved search of Trump&#39;s Florida resort in 2022 to recover classified documents that he had retained after leaving office.

That sparked one of two federal prosecutions Trump faced while out of power, neither of which went to trial. Trump denied wrongdoing and described all the cases against him as politically motivated. Federal prosecutors ended their efforts after his election, citing longstanding Justice Department policy not to prosecute a sitting president.

Trump&#39;s Republican allies joined him in alleging that the FBI had become politicized, though there is no evidence that Democratic President Joe Biden interfered with its investigative processes.

&quot;There are serious problems at the FBI. The American public knows it. They expect to see sweeping change,&quot; Republican US Senator Bill Hagerty said in early December after Trump&#39;s nomination of Patel.

Throughout his term, Wray said that he followed the law and strove to impartially carry out the FBI&#39;s duties. During a 2023 hearing before a House of Representatives panel he rebuffed the idea that he was pursuing a Democratic partisan agenda, noting that he had been a lifelong Republican.

&quot;The idea that I am biased against conservatives seems somewhat insane to me, given my own personal background,&quot; Wray said.

FBI directors are appointed for 10-year terms, a measure meant to avoid the appearance of partisanship after political turnover in the White House every four years.

Wray&#39;s term was not due to expire until 2027.

As he has built out his roster of Cabinet officials over the past few weeks, Trump has assembled a team ready to carry out two of his biggest priorities: retribution against his political adversaries and a wholesale reshaping of the US government.

Patel, who would need to be confirmed by the US Senate, has never worked at the FBI and only spent three years at the Justice Department earlier in his career in the National Security Division&#39;s Counterterrorism Section. If confirmed, he has pledged to shut down the FBI&#39;s headquarters building in Washington and drastically redefine the bureau&#39;s role with intelligence-gathering.

Throughout Trump&#39;s first term, Trump repeatedly mused about the idea of replacing Wray for not being forceful enough in defending him from the 2016 investigation, but former Attorney General Bill Barr resisted such efforts, Barr recounted in his book &quot;One Damn Thing After Another.&quot;

Wray, in his address to employees on Wednesday, urged them to continue to focus on their mission to keep Americans safe.

&quot;My goal is to keep the focus on  our mission &mdash; the indispensable work you&rsquo;re doing on behalf of the American people every day,&quot; Wray said, according to excerpts provided by the bureau.

&quot;In my view, this is the best way to avoid dragging the bureau deeper into the fray, while reinforcing the values and principles that are so important to how we do our work.&quot;

FISA WARRANTS, JAN 6 PROBES

The FBI has faced increasing criticism by Trump&#39;s supporters for its various roles in investigating Trump over the years.

Some of the concerns pre-dated Wray&#39;s tenure, including several damning reports by the Justice Department&#39;s inspector general which faulted the bureau for making numerous errors in its warrant applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court during its early investigation into Trump&#39;s 2016 campaign known as &quot;Crossfire Hurricane.&quot;

During his tenure, Wray has overseen reforms of the FBI&#39;s processes for securing FISA warrants.

The FBI during Wray&#39;s time has also played a major role in helping to investigate and arrest many of Trump&#39;s supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan 6, 2021, in a failed bid to block Congress from certifying Biden&#39;s election victory.

More than 1,500 people were criminally charged in the attack.

Trump has pledged to grant clemency to some of the Jan 6 defendants, though he has not provided details.

Throughout his time as FBI director, Wray has been known for his hawkish views on China, and has frequently warned that China represents the biggest national and economic security threat facing the United States.

Wray started his career at the Justice Department in 1997 as a federal prosecutor in the Atlanta-based Northern District of Georgia.

He was nominated by President George W. Bush in 2003 to lead the department&#39;s Criminal Division, where he oversaw a variety of investigations including post-9/11 efforts to combat terrorism and the Enron Task Force.

Wray also practiced law for about 17 years with the law firm King &amp; Spalding, and he clerked for former Judge J. Michael Luttig in the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit after earning his law degree from Yale Law School.

There are currently 99 million Swiss francs ($112 million) worth of frozen Syrian assets in Switzerland, most of which have been blocked for years, the Swiss government said on Wednesday.

The bulk of the total has been frozen since Switzerland adopted European Union sanctions against Syria in May 2011, the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (Seco) said.

Switzerland this week added three more people to its Syria-related sanctions list, following a move by the EU.

&quot;There are currently 318 individuals and 87 entities on the sanctions list,&quot; a Seco spokesperson told Reuters, declining to say if Switzerland had frozen any assets of ousted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Swiss financial institutions once held blocked Syrian assets worth 130 million Swiss francs ($147 million), the Neue Zuercher Zeitung newspaper reported.

&quot;Fluctuations in the total amount of restricted assets can be explained by several factors, including fluctuations in the value of restricted securities accounts and exchange rate effects and the delisting of certain sanctioned persons or entities,&quot; the Seco spokesperson said.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that Moscow was not ready to make concessions when it came to Ukraine and that President Vladimir Putin&#39;s own proposals on how to end the conflict needed to be implemented.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova made her comments in the context of a call by US President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday for an immediate ceasefire and negotiations between Ukraine and Russia to end &quot;the madness.&quot;

Zakharova said Russia was ready to engage with the new US administration on Ukraine, but had not yet received any serious, workable options to address what she said were Russia&#39;s legitimate security concerns and worries about the rights of Ukraine&#39;s Russian-speaking population.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been pushing hard for his country to be invited to join the NATO military alliance, responded to Trump&#39;s comments by saying Kyiv needed effective security guarantees.

But Zakharova said that anyone who thought Russia would make concessions on Ukraine was mistaken.

&quot;Firstly, Russia is acting. Secondly, if someone expects Russia to make some kind of concessions, apparently these people have a short memory and insufficient knowledge of the matter,&quot; she said.

Putin&#39;s proposals for peace needed to be implemented, she said.

The Kremlin chief has said that Ukraine must not join NATO and that Russia needs the entire territory of the four Ukrainian regions he has said are now part of Russia if there is to be peace.

Russia is one of 10 countries, including the US, China, Britain and Israel, that are developing their own generative AI models

President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia would develop artificial intelligence with BRICS partners and other countries, in a bid to challenge the dominance of the United States in one of the most promising and crucial technologies of the 21st century.

Speaking at Russia&#39;s flagship AI conference, Putin said the new AI Alliance Network would include national associations and development institutions in the field of AI from BRICS countries and other interested states.

&quot;Russia must participate on equal terms in the global race to create strong artificial intelligence. It is precisely the advanced solutions that Russian scientists are currently working on,&quot; Putin told an AI conference in Moscow.

&quot;We invite scientists from all over the world to join in the collaboration,&quot; he added.

Western sanctions intended to restrict Russia&#39;s access to the technologies it needs to sustain its war against Ukraine have resulted in the world&#39;s major producers of microchips halting exports to Russia, sorely limiting its AI ambitions.

Russia&#39;s dominant lender Sberbank is spearheading AI development in Russia, but Sberbank CEO German Gref acknowledged in 2023 that graphics processing units (GPUs), the microchips that underpin AI development, were the trickiest hardware for Russia to replace.

On Wednesday, the bank said national AI associations from BRICS members Brazil, China, India and South Africa, but also from Serbia, Indonesia and other non-BRICS countries, had joined the AI Alliance Network.

It said the network would facilitate joint research into technology and AI regulation, and provide opportunities for AI products to be sold in member countries&#39; markets.

RUSSIA SEEKS TO JOIN LEADING POWERS IN RACE FOR AI SUPREMACY

The United States and China are the world&#39;s top AI powers, and US President-elect Donald Trump has named a &quot;White House AI and Crypto Czar&quot; to help ensure the United States remains the richest and most technologically advanced power in the world.

But Putin&#39;s move to ally with China could change the dynamics of the AI race.

Russia is one of 10 countries, including the US, China, Britain and Israel, that are developing their own generative AI models. The Yakov and Partners consultancy, run by former McKinsey employees in Moscow, says this gives it the potential to become a much more significant player.

Russia sees the use of AI technologies across all sectors adding 11.2 trillion roubles ($109 billion) to gross domestic product in 2030, compared to 0.2 trillion roubles ($1.9 billion) in 2023.

Its AI strategy also says that 80% of all Russian workers should have AI skills by 2030, compared with 5% in 2023, while AI investment should grow seven-fold to 850 billion roubles.

Sberbank, which has developed a generative AI model called GigaChat, and technology leader Yandex YDEX.MM, with its YandexGPT model, dominate Russia&#39;s domestic AI market.

Russia currently ranks 31st of 83 countries by AI implementation, innovation and investment on UK-based Tortoise Media&#39;s Global AI Index, well behind not only the United States and China but also fellow BRICS members India and Brazil.

Stanford University&#39;s AI vibrancy tool, which evaluates 36 countries based on 42 AI indicators including research and development, ranks Russia 29th.

Russia could launch another hypersonic ballistic missile in Ukraine in the coming days, but Washington does not consider the Oreshnik weapon a game-changer in the war, a U.S. official said on Wednesday.

Russia first fired the Oreshnik missile at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Nov. 21, in what President Vladimir Putin cast as a response to Ukraine&#39;s first use of U.S. ATACMs ballistic missiles and British Storm Shadows to strike Russian territory with Western permission.

&quot;We assess that the Oreshnik is not a game-changer on the battlefield, but rather just another attempt by Russia to terrorize Ukraine, which will fail,&quot; the official said.

There was no immediate response from Russia.

Putin has previously said Russia may use the Oreshnik again, including to hit &quot;decision-making centers&quot; in Kyiv, if Ukraine keeps attacking Russia with long-range Western weapons.

Putin has claimed that the Oreshnik, or hazel tree, is impossible to intercept and that it has destructive power comparable to that of a nuclear weapon, even when fitted with a conventional warhead.

Some Western experts have said the novel feature of the Oreshnik was that it carried multiple warheads capable of simultaneously striking different targets - something usually associated with longer-range intercontinental ballistic missiles.

But the U.S. official downplayed the usefulness of the missiles, calling them &quot;experimental&quot; in nature and said that &quot;Russia likely possesses only a handful&quot; of them. The official also said the weapon has a smaller warhead than other missiles Russia has deployed in Ukraine.

Washington says more deliveries of U.S. air defence exports to Ukraine are on the way to the country.

The war is entering what some Russian and Western officials say could be its final and most dangerous phase as Moscow&#39;s forces advance at their fastest pace since the early weeks of the conflict.

President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office next month, has pushed for a ceasefire and negotiations to end the war quickly, leaving Washington&#39;s long-term support for Ukraine in question.

Russia&#39;s 2022 invasion of Ukraine has left tens of thousands of dead, displaced millions and triggered the biggest crisis in relations between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.

His document&#039;s strategies and policy suggestions could be implemented  or rejected by Trump

President Joe Biden is pushing US national security agencies ahead of Donald Trump&#39;s inauguration to devise new strategies to tackle the risky, deepening ties among Russia, Iran, North Korea and China, according to US officials.

In exchange for Iran&#39;s help with the Russian war effort in Ukraine, Moscow is giving its ally fighter aircraft, missile defense and space technology, Biden concluded in a national security memorandum issued on Tuesday.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is giving North Korea fuel, money and technology, and is recognizing it as a de facto nuclear state. Russia is conducting joint patrols with China in the Arctic, the administration said.

The classified document was described in general terms to reporters, but has not independently been reviewed by Reuters. Russia, China, Iran and North Korea have disputed similar assessments in the past and accused Washington of destabilizing behavior.

Biden&#39;s new document orders various arms of the US government to restructure groups currently organised by region to better focus on issues linking the four countries that span Europe and Asia.

The document&#39;s strategies and policy suggestions could be implemented - or rejected altogether - by President-elect Trump, a Republican who takes office on Jan 20.

&quot;When the new team sort of looks at it, I don&#39;t think they will see anything in it that is trying to box them in or tilt them toward one policy option or another,&quot; said one of the senior administration officials, who declined to be named.

Another official said they want to create &quot;new options so that a new team and Congress can really hit the ground running.&quot;

The officials said the challenges ahead include ensuring that any sanctions and export controls imposed on the four countries are applied in a coordinated way that doesn&#39;t risk blowback from those countries and enabling the United States to better handle simultaneous crises involving several of the countries. North Korean troops are now serving in Russia, for instance.

&quot;We&#39;re now in a world where our adversaries and our competitors are learning very quickly from one another,&quot; said one of the officials.

But there are limits to the countries&#39; cooperation, another of the officials said, including Russia and Iran&#39;s failing to assist their ally Bashar al-Assad, the former Syrian president who was toppled over the weekend.

&quot;This realignment sort of raises for China the question about what kind of future it wants to see and if it really wants to be all-in with this grouping,&quot; the person said.

Israelis and Palestinians are signaling new efforts to forge a ceasefire deal, even a limited one, for the first time in a year that would pause the fighting in Gaza and return to Israel some of the hostages still held in the Palestinian enclave.

Israel Defence Minister Israel Katz told his US counterpart Lloyd Austin in a phone call on Wednesday there was now a chance for a new deal that would allow the return of all the hostages, including US citizens, Katz&#39;s office said.

A Western diplomat in the region, however, said a deal was taking shape, but it would likely be limited in scope, involving the release of only a handful of hostages and a short pause in hostilities.

Such a truce and release would be only the second since the start of the war in October 2023.

The guarded optimism emerges as US President Joe Biden&#39;s national security adviser Jake Sullivan heads to Israel for talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday and then to Egypt and Qatar, co-mediators with the US on a deal.

Separately, President-elect Donald Trump has demanded that militants of the Palestinian Hamas group release the hostages held in Gaza before he takes over from Biden on Jan. 20. Otherwise, Trump has said, there will be &ldquo;hell to pay.&rdquo;

Trump&#39;s designated hostage envoy Adam Boehler has said he too is involved, having spoken already to Biden and to Netanyahu. Israel says 100 hostages remain captive in Gaza. Seven are believed to be US citizens.

Citing Trump&#39;s threat of &quot;hell to pay,&quot; Boehler told Israel&#39;s Channel 13 news last week: &quot;I would appeal to those people that have taken hostages: Make your best deal now. Make it now because every day that passes, it is going to get harder and harder and more Hamas lives will be lost.&quot;

Although Biden and Trump are working separately, their efforts overlap and both stand to gain from a deal. A US official said Trump&#39;s public statements about the need for a swift ceasefire &ldquo;have not been harmful.&rdquo;

The official said the priority is to get the hostages home, whether it is at the end of the Biden term or the start of the Trump term.

Steve Witkoff, Trump&#39;s designated Middle East envoy, met separately in late November with Netanyahu and Qatar&#39;s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said a source briefed on the talks.

TIMING IS APT FOR NETANYAHU

The timing for a deal may never have been better politically for Netanyahu.

The prime minister told reporters on Monday that Hamas&#39; increasing isolation following the collapse of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad&#39;s rule opened the door to a possible hostage deal even if it was too early to claim success.

Israel&#39;s military chief and the head of the Shin Bet internal security service were in Cairo on Tuesday to discuss post-war Gaza border crossings and administration, according to three Israeli security sources.

The public optimism of Israeli leaders over the past week has matched the general tone in internal discussions behind closed doors, according to an Israeli official.

For Netanyahu, concessions would be far easier now with Israel having reestablished its reputation as the most powerful Middle East force and its Iran-backed enemies in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria now posing less of a threat.

Netanyahu&#39;s once-fragile coalition has been strengthened by the addition of Foreign Minister Gideon Saar and his more centrist faction. Netanyahu, having achieved a ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon, can complete the picture with the return of the hostages in a deal with Hamas.

Over the past year, some of the far-right ministers in his cabinet had voiced objections, even threatening to bring down the government, should the war in Gaza end. But with Israel&#39;s enemies weakened, and his coalition strengthened, Netanyahu is far less vulnerable politically.

Saar said on Monday that Israel was now more optimistic about a possible hostage deal amid reports Hamas had asked other Gaza factions to help it compile a list of Israeli and foreign hostages in their custody, whether dead or alive.

A Palestinian official close to the talks and familiar with the positions of all the parties involved described what he called &quot;a fever of negotiations&quot; with ideas emerging on all sides, including among mediators in Egypt and Qatar.

Trump&#39;s involvement had given the talks a boost, even if the sides have yet to present lists of Palestinian prisoners and hostages to be exchanged or to complete plans for a temporary or phased truce, the Palestinian official said.

He said Hamas was willing to show some flexibility should there be guarantees Israel would not resume the fighting.

It is unclear how the sides can bridge the largest gap that has persisted through numerous rounds of failed negotiations; Hamas demands an end to the war, while Israel says the war will not end before Hamas no longer rules Gaza.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken headed to Jordan and Turkey on Wednesday for talks on Syria, the State Department said. Israel is not in his official itinerary but there is always a possibility he might add the stop.

The main commander of the fighters who toppled Bashar al-Assad said on Wednesday that he would dissolve the security forces of the former regime, close its prisons and hunt down anyone involved in the torture or killing of detainees.

Syrian rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa - better known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani - said in a statement to Reuters he will &quot;dissolve the security forces of the previous regime and close the notorious prisons.&quot;

Syria ran one of the most oppressive police states in the Middle East during five decades of Assad family rule. Sharaa, whose former al Qaeda affiliate Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) is now the country&#39;s most powerful force, must balance demands for justice from victims with the need to prevent violent reprisals and secure international aid.

Syrians have flocked to the infamous prisons where the Assad regime is estimated to have held tens of thousands of detainees, desperately looking for their loved ones. Some have been released alive, others were identified among the dead and thousands more have not yet been found.

Sharaa said in a separate statement on the Syrian state TV&#39;s Telegram channel that people who took part in the torture or killing of detainees would be hunted down, and pardons were out of the question.

&quot;We will pursue them in Syria, and we ask countries to hand over those who fled so we can achieve justice,&quot; said Sharaa.

The world is carefully watching to see if Syria&#39;s new rulers can stabilise the country and avoid unleashing violent revenge, after a 13-year civil war fought along sectarian and ethnic lines.

Since Assad&#39;s fall, 27-year-old Hayat al-Turki has been searching the abandoned cells of Syria&#39;s most notorious prison, the vast Sednaya complex, for any sign of her missing relatives, including her brother who vanished 14 years ago.

&quot;I was hopeful and optimistic to find someone from my missing prisoners - a brother, an uncle or a cousin - but I did not... I searched the whole prison,&quot; she said.

Mohammad al-Bashir, the man installed by Sharaa&#39;s fighters to lead an interim administration until March, said he aimed to bring back millions of refugees, create unity and provide basic services.

But the new administration has scant resources, he told Italian newspaper Il Corriere della Sera.

&quot;We have no foreign currency and as for loans and bonds we are still collecting data. So yes, financially we are very bad,&quot; said Bashir, who previously ran a small rebel-led administration in a pocket of northwestern Syria.

Rebuilding Syria is a colossal task following the civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of people, reduced cities to ruins and left the economy gutted by international sanctions. Millions of refugees still live in camps after one of the biggest displacements of modern times.

ENGAGING WARILY

Foreign officials are warily engaging with the former rebels, although HTS remains designated a terrorist organisation by Washington, the United Nations, EU and others.

The new government must &quot;uphold clear commitments to fully respect the rights of minorities, facilitate the flow of humanitarian assistance to all in need, prevent Syria from being used as a base for terrorism or posing a threat to its neighbours,&quot; US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.

US Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer told Reuters Washington remains cautious.

&quot;We have seen over the years any number of militant groups who have ... promised that they would govern in an inclusive way, and then see them fail to meet those promises,&quot; State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.

In addition to terrorism bans in place against the former rebels, Syria also remains under US, European and other financial sanctions imposed against Damascus under Assad.

Two senior US congressmen, a Republican and a Democrat, wrote a letter calling for Washington to suspend some sanctions. The most punishing war-time US sanctions are up for renewal this month, and the former rebels have told Reuters they are in touch with Washington about potentially easing them.

Spain&#39;s Foreign Minister Jose Luis Albares on Wednesday said at the Reuters NEXT conference that he expected the UN and European Union to discuss easing sanctions and removing HTS from lists of terrorist organisations.

The international community must quickly demand that the rebel forces transform into a political movement and respect human rights, he added.

&quot;We must move very fast because in a month, probably, decisions will have already been taken in Damascus and we will not be able to have the impact that we can have today,&quot; Albares said.

With the administration of US President Joe Biden entering its final weeks in office, Blinken and US national security adviser Jake Sullivan headed to the Middle East on Wednesday to work on a Gaza ceasefire and help ensure a smooth transition in Syria, US officials said. Their separate itineraries include stops in Jordan, Turkey, Israel, Qatar and Egypt.

For refugees, the prospect of returning home has brought a mixture of joy and grief over hardship in exile. Syrians lined up at the Turkish border on Wednesday to head home, speaking of their expectations for a better life following what was for many a decade of hardship in Turkey.

&quot;We have no one here. We are going back to Latakia, where we have family,&quot; said Mustafa as he prepared to enter Syria with his wife and three sons at the Cilvegozu border gate in southern Turkey. Dozens more Syrians were waiting to cross.

Khalil Haqqani became a minister in the Taliban&#39;s interim government after foreign forces withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021. He was a senior leader of the Haqqani network, a militant faction blamed for major attacks during the 20-year war, according to the U.S. State Department.

&quot;We lost a very brave Mujahid,&quot; Anas Haqqani told Reuters, using the Taliban&#39;s term for its fighters, meaning a holy warrior. &quot;We will never forget him and his sacrifice.&quot;

It was not immediately clear who was behind the blast.

The Taliban took over Afghanistan in 2021 as foreign forces withdrew, vowing to restore security, but attacks have continued in urban areas.

In 2022, a blast took place near the interior ministry, led by Haqqani network leader Sirajuddin Haqqani, killing four people. In 2023, Islamic State claimed an attack outside the Taliban-run foreign ministry that killed at least five.

The US Treasury classified Khalil Haqqani as a &quot;Specially Designated Global Terrorist&quot; in 2011 and the State Department offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest.

President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia would develop artificial intelligence with BRICS partners and other countries, in a bid to challenge the dominance of the United States in one of the most promising and crucial technologies of the 21st century.

Speaking at Russia&#39;s flagship AI conference, Putin said the new AI Alliance Network would include national associations and development institutions in the field of AI from BRICS countries and other interested states.

&quot;Russia must participate on equal terms in the global race to create strong artificial intelligence. It is precisely the advanced solutions that Russian scientists are currently working on,&quot; Putin told an AI conference in Moscow.

&quot;We invite scientists from all over the world to join in the collaboration,&quot; he added.

Western sanctions intended to restrict Russia&#39;s access to the technologies it needs to sustain its war against Ukraine have resulted in the world&#39;s major producers of microchips halting exports to Russia, sorely limiting its AI ambitions.

Russia&#39;s dominant lender Sberbank is spearheading AI development in Russia, but Sberbank CEO German Gref acknowledged in 2023 that graphics processing units (GPUs), the microchips that underpin AI development, were the trickiest hardware for Russia to replace.

On Wednesday, the bank said national AI associations from BRICS members Brazil, China, India and South Africa, but also from Serbia, Indonesia and other non-BRICS countries, had joined the AI Alliance Network.

It said the network would facilitate joint research into technology and AI regulation, and provide opportunities for AI products to be sold in member countries&#39; markets.

RUSSIA SEEKS TO JOIN LEADING POWERS IN RACE FOR AI SUPREMACY

The United States and China are the world&#39;s top AI powers, and US President-elect Donald Trump has named a &quot;White House AI and Crypto Czar&quot; to help ensure the United States remains the richest and most technologically advanced power in the world.

But Putin&#39;s move to ally with China could change the dynamics of the AI race.

Russia is one of 10 countries, including the US, China, Britain and Israel, that are developing their own generative AI models. The Yakov and Partners consultancy, run by former McKinsey employees in Moscow, says this gives it the potential to become a much more significant player.

Russia sees the use of AI technologies across all sectors adding 11.2 trillion roubles ($109 billion) to gross domestic product in 2030, compared to 0.2 trillion roubles ($1.9 billion) in 2023.

Its AI strategy also says that 80% of all Russian workers should have AI skills by 2030, compared with 5% in 2023, while AI investment should grow seven-fold to 850 billion roubles.

Sberbank, which has developed a generative AI model called GigaChat, and technology leader Yandex YDEX.MM, with its YandexGPT model, dominate Russia&#39;s domestic AI market.

Russia currently ranks 31st of 83 countries by AI implementation, innovation and investment on UK-based Tortoise Media&#39;s Global AI Index, well behind not only the United States and China but also fellow BRICS members India and Brazil.

Stanford University&#39;s AI vibrancy tool, which evaluates 36 countries based on 42 AI indicators including research and development, ranks Russia 29th.

US President-elect Donald Trump has invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to attend his inauguration next month, CBS News reported on Wednesday, citing multiple sources.

The invitation to the Jan. 20 inauguration in Washington occurred in early November, shortly after the Nov. 5 presidential election, and it was not clear if it had been accepted, CBS reported.

The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump said in an interview with NBC News conducted on Friday that he &quot;got along with very well&quot; with Xi and that they had &quot;had communication as recently as this week.&quot;

It would be unprecedented for a leader of China, a top US geopolitical rival, to attend a US presidential inauguration.

Trump has named numerous China hawks to key posts in his incoming administration, including Senator Marco Rubio as secretary of state.

The president-elect has said he will impose an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods unless Beijing does more to stop trafficking of the highly addictive narcotic fentanyl. He also threatened tariffs in excess of 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.

In late November, China&#39;s state media warned Trump that his pledge to slap additional tariffs on Chinese goods over fentanyl flows could drag the world&#39;s top two economies into a mutually destructive tariff war.

Separately on Wednesday, China&#39;s US Ambassador Xie Feng read a letter from Xi to a US-China Business Council gala in Washington, in which the Chinese leader said Beijing was prepared to stay in communication with the US

&quot;We should choose dialogue over confrontation and win-win cooperation over zero-sum games,&quot; Xi said in the letter.

Xie added that the two countries should not decouple supply chains. But Nicholas Burns, the US ambassador to Beijing, said in a pre-recorded video address that China at times tried to &quot;sugar coat&quot; challenging and competitive relations.

&quot;No amount of happy talk can obscure our profound differences,&quot; Burns said.

Google is chasing quantum computing because it promises computing speeds far faster than today&#039;s fastest systems

Google  on Monday said that it has overcome a key challenge in quantum computing with a new generation of chip, solving a computing problem in five minutes that would take a classical computer more time than the history of the universe.

Like other tech giants such as Microsoft and International Business Machines, Alphabet&#39;s Google is chasing quantum computing because it promises computing speeds far faster than today&#39;s fastest systems. While the math problem solved by the company&#39;s Santa Barbara, California quantum lab does not have commercial applications, Google hopes quantum computers will one day solve problems in medicine, battery chemistry and artificial intelligence that are out of reach for today&#39;s computers.

The results released Monday came from a new chip called Willow that has 105 &quot;qubits,&quot; which are the building blocks of quantum computers. Qubits are fast but error-prone, because they can be jostled by something as small as a subatomic particle from events in outer space.

As more qubits are packed onto a chip, those errors can add up to make the chip no better than a conventional computer chip. So since the 1990s, scientists have been working on quantum error-correction.

In a paper published in the journal Nature on Monday, Google said that it has found a way to string together the Willow chip&#39;s qubits so that error rates go down as the number of qubits goes up. The company also says it can correct errors in real time, a key step toward making its quantum machines practical.

&quot;We are past the break even point,&quot; Hartmut Neven, who leads the Google Quantum AI unit, said in an interview.

In 2019, IBM challenged Google&#39;s claim that Google&#39;s quantum chip solved a problem that would take a classical computer 10,000 years, saying the problem could be solved in two-and-a-half days using different technical assumptions about a classical system.

In a blog post Monday, Google said it took some of those concerns into account in its newest estimates. Even under the most idealistic conditions, Google said a classical computer would still take a billion years to get the same results as its newest chip.

Some of Google&#39;s rivals are producing chips with a larger number of qubits than Google, but Google is focused on making the most reliable qubits it can, Anthony Megrant, chief architect for Google Quantum AI, said in an interview.

Google fabricated its previous chips in a shared facility at the University of California, Santa Barbara, but built its own dedicated fabrication facility to produce its Willow chips. Megrant said that new facility will speed up how fast Google can make future chips, which are chilled in huge refrigerators called cryostats to run experiments.

&quot;If we have a good idea, we want somebody on the team to be able to ... get that into the clean room and into one of these cryostats as fast as possible, so we can get lots of cycles of learning,&quot; Megrant said.

The probe comes just as Starlink addresses security concerns before getting approval to launch broadband service in India

Indian police have sent a legal demand to Elon Musk&#39;s Starlink seeking details of who purchased its internet device that helps in sea navigation when smugglers with $4.2 billion worth of meth were caught in the biggest such Indian seizure.

Two people with direct knowledge of the police notice sent by Andaman and Nicobar island officials said Starlink had been asked for the purchaser&#39;s name and payment method, registration details and where the internet device was used when smugglers travelled in international waters from Myanmar to India.

Starlink and Andaman police did not respond to Reuters request for comment.

The incident has set off alarm bells as it is the first time Starlink&#39;s device has been used to navigate and reach Indian waters in a major drug haul.

The investigation comes just as the Musk-owned company is trying to address any potential security concerns before it is given a green light to launch its satellite broadband services in India.

Starlink recently won a lobbying battle after a bitter faceoff with billionaire Mukesh Ambani over how exactly New Delhi should allocate satellite spectrum to companies.

Police in the remote outpost of the Andaman and Nicobar islands seized more than 6,000 kg (13,000 pounds) of meth in late November in a Myanmar boat carrying sacks of suspected contraband, and found that the Starlink Mini internet device had been used. Starlink says the device works in international waters.

The police estimated that the seized meth had a retail market value of 360 billion rupees ($4.25 billion).

The first source said Andaman police had sent a notice on Dec 4 under an Indian law that empowers authorities to seek information from companies related to an investigation.

It has also sought the mobile number and email ID registered to the Starlink account, said both the sources, who declined to be named as the matter is sensitive.

The US government has approved the export of advanced artificial intelligence chips to a Microsoft-operated facility in the United Arab Emirates as part of the company&#39;s highly-scrutinised partnership with Emirati AI firm G42, Axios reported on Saturday, citing two people familiar with the deal.

Microsoft invested $1.5 billion in G42 earlier this year, giving the US company a minority stake and a board seat. As part of the deal, G42 would use Microsoft&#39;s cloud services to run its AI applications.

The deal, however, was scrutinised after US lawmakers raised concerns G42 could transfer powerful US AI technology to China. They asked for a US assessment of G42&#39;s ties to the Chinese Communist Party, military and government before the Microsoft deal advances.

The US Commerce Department, Microsoft and G42 did not immediately respond to Reuters&#39; requests for comment.

The approved export license requires Microsoft to prevent access to its facility in the UAE by personnel who are from nations under US arms embargoes or who are on the US Bureau of Industry and Security&#39;s Entity List, the Axios report said.

The restrictions cover people physically in China, the Chinese government or personnel working for any organisation headquartered in China, the report added.

US officials have said that AI systems could pose national security risks, including by making it easier to engineer chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. The Biden administration in October required the makers of the largest AI systems to share details about them with the US government.

G42 earlier this year said it was actively working with U.S. partners and the UAE&#39;s government to comply with AI development and deployment standards, amid concerns about its ties to China.

Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Company, the UAE&#39;s ruling family and US private equity firm Silver Lake hold stakes in G42. The company&#39;s chairman, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, is the UAE&#39;s national security advisor and the brother of the UAE&#39;s president.

Australia Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Sunday that criticism by Elon Musk of Australia&#39;s social media ban on children under 16 was the X owner pushing an agenda for the social platform, while indicating he was open to talk to the billionaire about the ban, legislated this week.

Australia approved the social media ban for children late on Thursday after an emotive debate that has gripped the nation, setting a benchmark for jurisdictions around the world with one of the toughest regulations targeting Big Tech.

The ban, which the centre-left government says is world-leading, could strain Australia&#39;s relationship with key ally the United States, where Musk, a central figure in the administration of president-elect Donald Trump, said in a post this month it seemed a &quot;backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians&quot;.

Albanese, asked on Sunday if he was prepared to talk to Musk about the social media ban said: &quot;We&#39;ll talk to anyone&quot;.

&quot;With regard to Elon Musk, he has an agenda, he&#39;s entitled to push that as the owner of X, formerly known as Twitter,&quot; Albanese added in remarks on Australian Broadcasting Corp television.

The law forces tech giants from Instagram and Facebook owner Meta, to TikTok to stop minors logging in or face fines of up to A$49.5 million ($32 million). A trial of enforcement methods starts in January with the ban to take effect in a year.

&quot;We are determined to get this done, the parliament has overwhelmingly passed this legislation,&quot; Albanese told the broadcaster.

X did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment outside of business hours.

Albanese&#39;s Labour Party won crucial support from the opposition conservatives for the bill that was fast-tracked through the country&#39;s parliament as part of 31 bills pushed through in a chaotic final day of parliament for the year.

Australians reacted on Friday with a mixture of anger and relief to a social media ban on children under 16 that the government says is world-leading, but which tech giants like TikTok argue could push young people to &quot;darker corners of the internet&quot;.

Australia approved the social media ban for children late on Thursday after an emotive debate that has gripped the nation, setting a benchmark for jurisdictions around the world with one of the toughest regulations targeting Big Tech.

The law forces tech giants from Instagram and Facebook owner Meta Platforms to TikTok to stop minors from logging in or face fines of up to A$49.5 million ($32 million). A trial of enforcement methods will start in January, with the ban to take effect in a year.

&quot;Platforms now have a social responsibility to ensure the safety of our kids is a priority for them,&quot; Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Friday

&quot;We&#39;re making sure that mums and dads can have that different conversation today and in future days.&quot;

Announcing the details of the ban earlier this month, Albanese cited the risks to physical and mental health of children from excessive social media use, in particular the risks to girls from harmful depictions of body image, and misogynist content aimed at boys.

In Sydney on Friday, reaction to the ban was mixed.

&quot;I think that&#39;s a great idea, because I found that the social media for kids (is) not really appropriate, sometimes they can look at something they shouldn&#39;t,&quot; said Sydney resident Francesca Sambas.

Others were more scathing.

&quot;I&#39;m feeling very angry, I feel that this government has taken democracy and thrown it out the window,&quot; said 58-year-old Shon Klose.

&quot;How could they possibly make up these rules and these laws and push it upon the people?&quot;

Children, meanwhile, said they would try to find a way around the ban.

&quot;I feel like I still will use it, just secretly get in,&quot; said 11-year-old Emma Wakefield.

WORLD FIRST

Countries including France and some US states have passed laws to restrict access for minors without a parent&#39;s permission, but the Australian ban is absolute. A full under-14s ban in Florida is being challenged in court on free speech grounds.

Albanese&#39;s Labor party won crucial support from the opposition conservatives for the bill that was fast-tracked through the country&#39;s parliament as part of 31 bills pushed through in a chaotic final day of parliament for the year.

The government has said enough notice was given as it first flagged the ban after a parliamentary enquiry earlier this year that heard testimony from parents of children who had self-harmed due to cyber bullying.

But it was criticised by social media firms and some lawmakers who say the bill has lacked proper scrutiny.

A spokesperson for TikTok, which is hugely popular with teen users, said on Friday the process had been rushed and risked putting children into greater danger.

&quot;We&#39;re disappointed the Australian government has ignored the advice of the many mental health, online safety, and youth advocacy experts who have strongly opposed the ban,&quot; the spokesperson said.

Albanese said on Friday passing the bill before the age verification trial has been completed was the correct approach.

&quot;We&#39;ve got your back is our message to Australian parents,&quot; Albanese said.

&quot;We don&#39;t argue that its implementation will be perfect, just like the alcohol ban for under 18s doesn&#39;t mean that someone under 18 never has access, but we know that it&#39;s the right thing to do.&quot;

The ban could strain Australia&#39;s relationship with key ally the United States, where X owner Elon Musk, a central figure in the administration of president-elect Donald Trump, said in a post this month it seemed a &quot;backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians&quot;.

It also builds on an existing mood of antagonism between Australia and mostly US-domiciled tech giants. Australia was the first country to make social media platforms pay media outlets royalties for sharing their content and now plans to threaten them with fines for failing to stamp out scams.

Australia on Thursday passed into law a social media ban for children aged under 16 after an emotive debate that gripped the nation, setting a benchmark for jurisdictions around the world with one of the toughest regulations targeting Big Tech.

The law forces tech giants from Instagram and Facebook owner Meta to TikTok to stop minors logging in or face fines of up to A$49.5 million ($32 million). A trial of methods to enforce it will start in January with the ban to take effect in a year.

The Social Media Minimum Age bill sets Australia up as a test case for a growing number of governments which have legislated or said they plan to legislate an age restriction on social media amid concern about its mental health impact on young people.

Countries including France and some US states have passed laws to restrict access for minors without a parent&#39;s permission, but the Australian ban is absolute. A full under-14s ban in Florida is being challenged in court on free speech grounds.

Getting the law passed after a marathon last day of Australia&#39;s parliamentary year marks a political win for centre-left Prime Minister Anthony Albanese who goes to an election in 2025 amid sagging opinion polls. The ban faced opposition from privacy advocates and some child rights groups, but 77% of the population wanted it, according to latest polls.

Against the backdrop of a parliamentary inquiry through 2024 which heard evidence from parents of children who had self-harmed due to social media bullying, domestic media backed the ban led by Rupert Murdoch&#39;s News Corp NWSA.O, the country&#39;s biggest newspaper publisher, with a campaign called &quot;Let Them Be Kids&quot;.

The ban could however strain Australia&#39;s relationship with key ally the United States, where X owner Elon Musk, a central figure in the administration of president-elect Donald Trump, said in a post this month it seemed a &quot;backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians&quot;.

It also builds on an existing mood of antagonism between Australia and mostly US-domiciled tech giants. Australia was the first country to make social media platforms pay media outlets royalties for sharing their content and now plans to threaten them with fines for failing to stamp out scams.

Representatives of Meta, TikTok and X, which the government has said would be affected by the ban, were not immediately available for comment.

The companies - including Alphabet&#39;s GOOGL.O Google, whose subsidiary YouTube is exempt because it is widely used in schools - had argued the legislation should be postponed until after the age verification trial.

&quot;It&#39;s cart before horse,&quot; said Sunita Bose, managing director of Digital Industry Group, which has most social media companies as members.

&quot;We have the bill but we don&#39;t have guidance from the Australian government around what are the right methods that a whole host of services subject to this law will need to employ,&quot; Bose added, speaking to Reuters.

NATION DIVIDED

Some youth advocacy groups and academics had warned the ban could shut off the most vulnerable young people, including LGBTQIA and migrant teenagers, from support networks. The Australian Human Rights Commission said the law may infringe human rights of young people by interfering with their ability to participate in society.

Privacy advocates meanwhile warned the law could lead to heightened collection of personal data, clearing the path for digital identification-based state surveillance. A last-minute change to the bill specified that platforms must offer an alternative to making users upload identification documents.

&quot;This is boomers trying to tell young people how the internet should work to make themselves feel better,&quot; said Sarah Hanson-Young, a senator for the left-leaning Greens, in a late Senate sitting just before the bill was passed 34 votes to 19.

But parent groups pushed for intervention, seizing on comments from US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy who in 2023 said social media was worsening a youth mental health crisis to the point where it should carry a health warning.

&quot;Putting an age limit and giving the control back to the parents, I think it&#39;s a starting point,&quot; said Australian anti-bullying advocate Ali Halkic, whose 17-year-old son Allem took his life in 2009 following social media bullying.

&quot;For the 10 to 15 year olds (the ban) will be hard to manage, but the next generation who are coming up who are seven, eight or nine years old, if they don&#39;t know what it is, why is it important?&quot; he added in a phone interview.

Enie Lam, a Sydney school student who recently turned 16, said social media contributed to body image problems and cyber bullying but a total ban may drive young people to less visible, more dangerous parts of the internet.

&quot;It will only create a generation of young people who will be more technologically literate in bypassing these walls,&quot; she told Reuters. &quot;It won&#39;t achieve the desired effects.&quot;

&quot;We all know social media isn&#39;t good for us but the social media ban generally sees a lot of young people who are strongly against it.&quot;
