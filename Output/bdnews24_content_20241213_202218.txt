The new prime minister is set to navigate political gridlock and tackle a critical budget crisis

French President Emmanuel Macron named Francois Bayrou as his fourth prime minister of 2024 on Friday, charging the veteran centrist with steering the country out of its second political crisis in the past six months.

The priority for Bayrou, a close Macron ally, will be passing a special law to roll over the 2024 budget, with a nastier battle over the 2025 legislation looming early next year. Parliamentary pushback over the 2025 bill led to the downfall of former Prime Minister Michel Barnier's government.

Bayrou, 73, is expected to put forward his list of ministers in the coming days, but is likely to face the same difficulties as Barnier in steering legislation through a hung parliament comprising three warring blocs. His proximity to the deeply unpopular Macron will also prove to be a vulnerability.

Jordan Bardella, president of the far-right National Rally, or RN, party, said it would not be calling for an immediate no-confidence motion, while fellow RN leader Marine Le Pen said Bayrou should listen to the opposition's budgetary wishes.

Reaction to Bayrou's appointment on the left was more mixed.

Communist leader Fabien Roussel said his party would hold fire against Bayrou, as long as he did not ram through legislation.

However, far-left France Unbowed party leaders said they would be seeking to remove Bayrou, and Greens boss Marine Tondelier said she would support a no-confidence motion if Bayrou ignored their tax and pensions concerns.

France's festering political malaise has raised doubts about whether Macron will complete his second presidential term, which ends in 2027. It has also lifted French borrowing costs and left a power vacuum in the heart of Europe, just as Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House.

Macron spent the days after Barnier's ouster speaking to leaders from the conservatives to the Communists in an effort to lock in support for Bayrou. The RN and France Unbowed were excluded.

There was no immediate comment from the conservative Les Republicains party, which supported the previous government, nor from Socialist Party leaders, whose involvement in Bayrou's coalition may come with a hefty price tag in next year's budget.

"Now we will see how many billions the support of the Socialist Party will cost," a government adviser said on Friday.

NO LEGISLATIVE ELECTION BEFORE SUMMER

Macron will hope Bayrou can stave off no-confidence votes until at least July, when France will be able to hold a new parliamentary election, but his own future as president will inevitably be questioned if the government should fall again.

Bayrou, the founder of the Democratic Movement, or MoDem, party which has been a part of Macron's ruling alliance since 2017, has himself run for president three times, leaning on his rural roots as the longtime mayor of the south-western town of Pau.

Macron appointed Bayrou as justice minister in 2017 but he resigned only weeks later amid an investigation into his party's alleged fraudulent employment of parliamentary assistants. He was cleared of fraud charges this year.

Bayrou's first real test will come early in the new year when lawmakers need to pass a belt-tightening 2025 budget bill.

However, the fragmented nature of the National Assembly, rendered nigh-on ungovernable after Macron's June snap election, means Bayrou will likely be living day-to-day, at the mercy of the president's opponents, for the foreseeable future.

Barnier's budget bill, which aimed for 60 billion euros in savings to assuage investors increasingly concerned by France's  percent deficit, was deemed too miserly by the far-right and left, and the government's failure to find a way out of the gridlock has seen French borrowing costs push higher still.

The insurgents seize the last remaining junta-controlled border outpost, the BGP-5 battalion near Maungdaw

The Arakan Army (AA), a rebel group in Myanmar, has reportedly captured the town of Maungdaw in Rakhine state amid the ongoing conflict with government forces.

Consequently, the entirety of the 270km Bangladesh-Myanmar border is now under the control of the AA, according to a BBC report.

The insurgents seized the last remaining junta-controlled border outpost, the BGP-5 battalion near Maungdaw, on Dec 8 following months of intense fighting.

Videos released by the AA show their forces besieging the outpost with heavy gunfire, while Myanmar’s air force launched counterattacks.

Since the military coup in 2021, which ousted Myanmar’s democratically elected government, the country has been embroiled in a devastating civil war. The AA has been actively fighting the junta for over eight months.

Security analysts note that some Rohingya-aligned groups in Rakhine, including the Arakan Rohingya Army (ARA) and the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), initially sided with the junta. However, the latest defeat marks another significant setback for coup leader Gen Min Aung Hlaing, as the junta continues to lose strategic towns to the AA.

Earlier this year, military units, including the BGP-5 battalion, were withdrawn from Maungdaw in September. The compound, spanning approximately 20 hectares, was built on land formerly occupied by the Rohingya village of Maung Thugyi, which was burned and cleared during the military’s violent crackdown on the Rohingya in 2017.

The scale of the fighting in Maungdaw since June suggests that the junta has suffered heavy losses, with reports of hundreds of soldiers killed. On Dec 7, the AA announced the capture of over 30 junta military camps in Rakhine’s Ann Township, repelling air and ground attacks.

Reports indicate that Myanmar soldiers began surrendering in Maungdaw. Videos from the AA show soldiers emerging with white flags, many injured or limping. Inside the outpost, footage reveals the devastation, with piles of bodies and AA fighters celebrating their victory.

The AA claimed that over 450 junta soldiers were killed during the Maungdaw siege. They released images of captured Brig Gen Thurein Tun and other officers kneeling beneath a raised AA banner.

Pro-military commentators in Myanmar have expressed despair on social media following the fall of BGP-5, underscoring the AA's growing strength and effectiveness.

Although the AA was established relatively late, in 2009, it has emerged as one of Myanmar’s most formidable rebel forces. However, questions remain about how the group will treat the approximately 600,000 Rohingya still living in Rakhine, especially after the military expelled over 700,000 Rohingya in 2017.

A Rohingya man who recently fled Maungdaw to Bangladesh described widespread destruction. "Eighty per cent of the housing in Maungdaw and the surrounding villages has been destroyed," one Rohingya man who left Maungdaw recently for Bangladesh told the BBC.

"The town is deserted. Almost all the shops and houses have been looted."

Relations between the AA and the Rohingya population have long been strained, and tensions have escalated further. Many Rohingya groups in Bangladesh refugee camps initially aligned with the junta and are now in a precarious position.

The AA has also targeted Rohingya militias tied to the junta, including the ARA, ARSA, and the Rohingya Solidarity Organisation, forcing them to abandon their bases.

Earlier this year, leaders of some Rohingya groups sought refuge in Bangladesh with weapons but were detained by local authorities.

The Myanmar government continues to deny the Rohingya citizenship, and many in Rakhine believe they should not remain in the region. A Rohingya man said, "Our situation today is even more difficult than it was under the rule of the military junta."

US President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said he was picking Kari Lake, a former news anchor and a hardline Republican who failed to win an Arizona Senate seat last month, to be the director of US government-funded media outlet Voice of America.

Trump, in a post on his Truth Social site, said Lake will "ensure that the American values of Freedom and Liberty are broadcast around the World FAIRLY and ACCURATELY, unlike the lies spread by the Fake News Media."

Lake, a strong Trump supporter who has echoed his false claims about fraud at the 2020 election, also lost the governor's race in swing state Arizona in 2022 and was previously an anchor at Phoenix-based Fox 10.

Voice of America (VOA) is an international media broadcaster that operates in more than 40 languages online and on radio and television.

During his first term in office, Trump clashed with VOA and accused it of amplifying Chinese propaganda after it showed a segment on a light show marking the reopening of Wuhan, the city where the coronavirus pandemic first emerged.

He has suggested in the past that vaccines might be linked to autism

Updated : 13 Dec 2024, 01:29 AM

US President-elect Donald Trump in an interview published on Thursday said he will be talking to Robert F Kennedy Jr, his nominee to run the Department of Health and Human Services, about ending childhood vaccination programmes.

When asked if he would sign off if Kennedy decided to end childhood vaccinations programmes, Trump told Time magazine, "we're going to have a big discussion. The autism rate is at a level that nobody ever believed possible. If you look at things that are happening, there's something causing it."

When asked if the discussion could result in his administration getting rid of some vaccinations, Trump said: "It could if I think it's dangerous, if I think they are not beneficial, but I don't think it's going to be very controversial in the end."

Asked in the Nov 25 interview if he thinks childhood autism is linked to vaccines, Trump said: "No, I'm going to be listening to Bobby," referring to Kennedy. Trump said he had a lot of respect for Kennedy and his views on vaccinations.

Kennedy, who opposed state and federal COVID-19 restrictions and was accused of spreading misinformation about the virus, has for years sown doubts over the safety and efficacy of vaccines, including asserting a debunked link between vaccines and autism.

Trump has suggested in the past that vaccines might be linked to autism. "I want to see the numbers," he said. "At the end of the studies that we're doing, and we're going all out, we're going to know what's good and what's not good."

RETRACTED AND DISCREDITED

Many of the claims that vaccines cause autism can be traced to a retracted 1998 study published in medical journal The Lancet. The paper, written by British doctor Andrew Wakefield, has been widely discredited.

Research, including a 2014 meta-analysis of studies involving more than 1.2 million children, found no association between vaccines and autism.

Autism advocacy group Autism Speaks says it "remains aligned with the scientific consensus, which confirms that vaccines do not cause autism."

Former FDA commissioner and current Pfizer board member Scott Gottlieb has said if Kennedy follows through on his intentions to end vaccine mandates "it will cost lives in this country.”

He said lower vaccination rates could lead to large outbreaks of once nearly eradicated diseases like measles. "For every 1,000 cases of measles that occur in children, there will be one death. And we are not good in this country at diagnosing and treating measles,” Gottlieb told CNBC last month.

Kennedy disputes the anti-vaccine tag, but chaired the Children’s Health Defence, a nonprofit organization that focuses on anti-vaccine messaging.

"He (Kennedy) does not disagree with vaccinations, all vaccinations. He disagrees probably with some," Trump said.

If he is confirmed to run HHS, Kennedy would oversee the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, which controls what vaccines are recommended for Americans and when they should receive them. It also runs the Vaccines for Children programme that provides free vaccines for some children.

The remarks are in line with a comment Trump made in an interview with Meet The Press on Sunday in which he said that the potential risks from vaccines should be studied.

"I think vaccines are — certain vaccines — are incredible. But maybe some aren’t. And if they aren’t, we have to find out," he said.

During a presidential debate in his 2016 White House campaign, Trump appeared to embrace the debunked autism link. He said he was "totally in favour of vaccines," but suggested spreading out recommended inoculations over a longer period of time. "And I think you're going to have, I think you're going to see a big impact on autism."

Title: Biden pardons 39 people, commutes sentences of 1,500 others

The moves come after the president signed an unconditional pardon for his son Hunter

Outgoing US President Joe Biden said on Thursday that he was pardoning 39 people convicted of non-violent crimes and commuting the sentences of nearly 1,500 others who were serving long prison terms.

The moves come over a week after the president signed an unconditional pardon for his son Hunter.

Officials said last week that the White House was listening to demands for Biden to extend the same grace to thousands of people wronged by the US judicial system.

The commutations on Thursday were announced for those who were placed on home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Biden said these people would have received shorter sentences if charged under today's laws, policies and practices.

Sources had told Reuters last week that the pardons being discussed included those convicted of nonviolent drug offenses and people identified by civil rights groups as unjustly incarcerated.

"As president, I have the great privilege of extending mercy to people who have demonstrated remorse and rehabilitation, restoring opportunity for Americans to participate in daily life and contribute to their communities, and taking steps to remove sentencing disparities for non-violent offenders, especially those convicted of drug offenses," Biden said.

The president added that he will take more steps in the weeks ahead and that his administration will continue reviewing clemency petitions.

US Rep Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, one of the leading Democrats behind a letter to Biden last month urging him to issue clemency to Americans with nonviolent offenses, commended the president for taking "meaningful and historic action."

Her statement noted that he could take further steps to exercise his power during his remaining 39 days in office.

The White House said that the clemencies granted by Biden were the most ever in a single day.

The list primarily includes Americans placed under home confinement during the Covid-19 pandemic to mitigate the spread of the virus, experts say, rather than many individuals civil rights groups have been advocating for.

"We do think he can pardon more people - specifically people who are currently incarcerated and might have lower sentences if they were convicted today," said Tierra Bradford, senior program manager at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.

US President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has saidthat he would act on his first day in office to pardon rioters involved in the Jan 6, 2021, Capitol attack, further building expectations for a broad granting of clemency.

Israel killed 13 Palestinians in two airstrikes in Gaza on Thursday that Gaza medics and Hamas said were part of a force protecting humanitarian aid trucks. Israel's military said they were Hamas militants trying to hijack the shipment.

Many of those killed in the attacks on Rafah and Khan Younis in southern Gaza had links to Hamas, according to sources close to the group. The 13 were among 36 Palestinians killed in separate Israeli attacks on Thursday, the medics said.

The Israeli military said in a statement the two airstrikes aimed to ensure the safe delivery of humanitarian aid and accused Hamas members of planning to prevent the aid from reaching Gaza civilians who need it.

The statement said the Hamas members aimed to hijack the aid "in support of continuing terrorist activity".

Armed gangs have repeatedly hijacked aid trucks after they roll into the enclave, and Hamas has formed a task force to confront them. The Hamas-led forces have killed over two dozen members of the gangs in recent months, Hamas sources and medics said.

The Palestinian news agency WAFA said those killed in the two airstrikes were guarding the aid trucks.

Hamas said Israeli military strikes have killed at least 700 police tasked with securing aid trucks in Gaza since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023. It has accused Israel of trying to protect acts of looting and "creating anarchy and chaos to prevent aid from reaching the people of Gaza".

Later on Thursday, the Israeli military ordered residents of several districts in the heart of Gaza City to evacuate, citing new rocket launches from those areas that it would respond to.

"This is a pre-warning before an attack," read the military statement posted on X. The warning was also channeled to some residents through audio and written text on their mobile phones.

The evacuation orders caused a new wave of displacement. At nightfall, dozens of families streamed out of the areas heading toward the center of the city.

ISRAELI STRIKES IN GAZA CITY, CENTRAL GAZA

Children were among seven people killed when a residential building in Gaza City's al-Jalaa Street was bombed in a separate attack, WAFA said.

Another Israeli bombing killed 15 people in a house where displaced people were taking shelter, west of Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip, medics and WAFA said.

In the northern Gaza refugee camp of Jabalia, where the army has operated since October, health officials said an orthopedic doctor, Saeed Judeh, was shot dead by Israeli forces while on his way to Al-Awda Hospital where he usually treated patients.

The health ministry said his death raised to 1,057 the number of healthcare workers killed since the war began.

Months of ceasefire efforts by Arab mediators, Egypt and Qatar, backed by the United States, have failed to conclude a deal between the two warring sides.

On Wednesday, the United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly voted to demand an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire and the immediate release of all hostages seized in Israel in October 2023 and held by Hamas in Gaza.

The war in the Palestinian enclave began after Hamas gunmen stormed into Israeli communities, killing around 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages back to Hamas-run Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.

Since then, Israel's military has leveled swathes of Gaza, driving nearly all of its 2.3 million people from their homes, giving rise to deadly hunger and disease and killing more than 44,800 people, according to Palestinian health authorities.

In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where violence has surged since the Gaza war began, Israeli forces shot dead two Palestinians, at least one of them a militant, in separate raids in Nablus and Qalqilya, Palestinian and Israeli officials said.

Around 810 Palestinians, including many militants and civilians, have been killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank since October 2023.

President-elect Donald Trump is now considering tapping Richard Grenell, his former intelligence chief, to be a special envoy for Iran, according to two people familiar with the transition plans.

"He's definitely in the running," said a person familiar with transition deliberations, who asked not to be identified.

No final decisions on either personnel or strategy on Iran have been made official yet by Trump, including whether to slap fresh sanctions on the country, pursue diplomacy or both in order to halt their nuclear program.

Trump's plans for the role have not previously been reported. Neither Trump's team nor Grenell responded to requests for comment.

"Richard Grenell is a fabulous person, A STAR. He will be someplace, high up!" Trump said in a post on his social media platform late Wednesday following the Reuters report.

Grenell, in a separate post on X, called the report "wrong" but gave no other details.

Still, Trump's consideration of a key ally for such a posting sends a signal to the region that the new US president may be open to talks with a country he has previously threatened and whose elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps have sought to assassinate him, according to the US government. Iran has denied the claim.

In the role, Grenell is expected to be tasked with speaking with countries in and beyond the region about the Iran issue as well as taking Tehran's temperature on possible negotiations, said one of the people.

Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian, who is viewed as relatively moderate, said following Trump's election that Tehran must "deal with the US" and "manage" relations with its arch-foe.

Iran has suffered a series of strategic setbacks, including Israel's assault on Tehran's proxy militias Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon and the ouster of Iranian ally Bashar al-Assad in Syria.

But tensions remain high more than a year after Hamas attacked southern Israel, launching the Gaza war. Meanwhile, other Iranian proxies have attacked US, Israeli and other Western targets, and Tehran has accelerated its nuclear program while limiting the UN nuclear watchdog's ability to monitor it.

It's not the first job Trump has considered for Grenell, who served as Trump's ambassador to Germany, a special presidential envoy for Serbia and Kosovo peace negotiations, and as acting director of national intelligence during Trump's 2017-2021 term.

After campaigning for Trump in the lead up to the Nov 5 election, he was a top contender to be secretary of state and for special envoy for the Ukraine war. Those jobs went to US Senator Marco Rubio and retired lieutenant general Keith Kellogg, respectively. Trump takes office next month.

During his first term in office, in 2020, Trump ordered a US air strike that killed Iran's top military commander, Qassem Soleimani.

Trump in 2018 also reneged on a nuclear deal struck by his predecessor Barack Obama in 2015 and re-imposed US economic sanctions on Iran that had been relaxed. The deal had limited Iran's ability to enrich uranium, a process that can yield fissile material for nuclear weapons.

Iran now is "dramatically" accelerating enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% level that is weapons grade, the UN nuclear watchdog chief told Reuters last week. Iran says its nuclear program only serves peaceful purposes.

Two senior members of Taiwan's government are in the United States to meet people connected to President-elect Donald Trump's transition team, five sources told Reuters, in an effort by Taiwan to establish ties with the incoming administration.

Lin Fei-fan and Hsu Szu-chien, both deputy secretaries-general of Taiwan's National Security Council and several of their staff have travelled to the Washington area for meetings through this week, the sources said on condition of anonymity.

Reuters was not able to confirm who from the US side would join the meetings or the agenda.

Taiwan's de facto embassy in Washington, China's embassy and the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment.

The visit by Lin and Hsu comes as China's military has stepped up activity near the Taiwan Strait, in what Taiwan has said is Beijing's effort to set a "red line" for the incoming Trump administration and US allies.

One of the sources said the meetings were with individuals in Trump transition circles but would not include nominees for top positions in Trump's next administration, given sensitivity in Beijing over any talks between Taiwanese and US officials.

The meetings are with "Republicans likely to populate mid-tier political positions" in the Trump administration, a second source said. A third source said it was "safe to say" Lin and Hsu were meeting the Trump transition team.

A fourth source added that visits to the United States at such a level are not rare and that they are to meet "old friends", including people in Trump's circle.

The United States does not have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, a democratically governed island that China claims as its own territory. Taiwan rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only the island's people can decide their future.

HOPE AND WORRY IN TAIWAN

Trump's electoral win in November has sparked hope in Taipei that he will pursue a tough line with China but also anxiety given his comments that the island should pay the US for its defence.

Trump has named numerous China hawks to key posts in his incoming administration, including Senator Marco Rubio as Secretary of State, who has called for unfettered interaction between US and Taiwan officials.

Those nominations have been encouraging for Taipei, which Reuters has reported may place large new arms deals to show it takes seriously Trump's statements that Taiwan should pay "protection" money to the United States.

Engagement to date between Taiwan and the incoming administration appears to fall in a gray area of unofficial contact and has been low-key. That's a departure from the period before Trump's first term, when in December 2016, the month before his inauguration, he held a phone call with then-Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen.

That call marked the first time since 1979 that a US president-elect had spoken with the island's president, a move that angered China.

Ahead of his second inauguration, scheduled for Jan 20, CBS News reported on Wednesday that Trump had invited Xi to attend the event, something that would be unprecedented for a Chinese leader.

The president-elect's camp and China did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report, but Trump said in an interview with NBC News conducted last Friday that he "got along with very well" with Xi and that they had "had communication as recently as this week."

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Thursday lashed out at his political opponents as "anti-state forces", said North Korea has hacked the country's elections and defended his short-lived martial law order as a legal move to protect democracy.

His comments on Thursday came as the leader of Yoon's own party said the president had shown no signs of resigning and must be impeached.

He faces a second impeachment vote in parliament expected on Saturday, a week after the first one failed because most of the ruling party boycotted the vote.

"I will fight to the end," he said near the end of a lengthy address broadcast on television.

Yoon is under criminal investigation for alleged insurrection over the botched Dec 3 martial law declaration, which sparked the biggest political crisis in South Korea in decades.

Lawmakers broke through a police cordon, some by scaling the fence, to enter parliament and demand Yoon to rescind martial law within hours of the declaration.

In comments that echoed his justification for declaring emergency rule in the first place, he said the "criminal groups" that have paralysed state affairs and disrupted the rule of law must be stopped at all cost from taking over government.

Yoon said the country's National Election Commission was hacked by North Korea last year but the independent agency refused to cooperate in an investigation and inspection of its system to safeguard integrity.

He said the refusal was enough to raise questions about the integrity of the April 2024 election and led him to declare martial law.

Yoon's People Power Party (PPP) suffered a crushing defeat in the April election, allowing the Democratic Party overwhelming control of the single-chamber assembly. Even so, the opposition needs eight members of the PPP to vote with them for the president to be impeached

Just before Yoon's televised address, PPP leader Han Dong-hoon said Yoon had to be stripped of power and the only way to accomplish that is for the party to back the impeachment bill.

US President-elect Donald Trump has invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to attend his inauguration next month, CBS News reported on Wednesday, citing multiple sources.

The invitation to the Jan. 20 inauguration in Washington occurred in early November, shortly after the Nov. 5 presidential election, and it was not clear if it had been accepted, CBS reported.

The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump said in an interview with NBC News conducted on Friday that he "got along with very well" with Xi and that they had "had communication as recently as this week."

It would be unprecedented for a leader of China, a top US geopolitical rival, to attend a US presidential inauguration.

Trump has named numerous China hawks to key posts in his incoming administration, including Senator Marco Rubio as secretary of state.

The president-elect has said he will impose an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods unless Beijing does more to stop trafficking of the highly addictive narcotic fentanyl. He also threatened tariffs in excess of 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.

In late November, China's state media warned Trump that his pledge to slap additional tariffs on Chinese goods over fentanyl flows could drag the world's top two economies into a mutually destructive tariff war.

Separately on Wednesday, China's US Ambassador Xie Feng read a letter from Xi to a US-China Business Council gala in Washington, in which the Chinese leader said Beijing was prepared to stay in communication with the US

"We should choose dialogue over confrontation and win-win cooperation over zero-sum games," Xi said in the letter.

Xie added that the two countries should not decouple supply chains. But Nicholas Burns, the US ambassador to Beijing, said in a pre-recorded video address that China at times tried to "sugar coat" challenging and competitive relations.

"No amount of happy talk can obscure our profound differences," Burns said.

Israelis and Palestinians are signaling new efforts to forge a ceasefire deal, even a limited one, for the first time in a year that would pause the fighting in Gaza and return to Israel some of the hostages still held in the Palestinian enclave.

Israel Defence Minister Israel Katz told his US counterpart Lloyd Austin in a phone call on Wednesday there was now a chance for a new deal that would allow the return of all the hostages, including US citizens, Katz's office said.

A Western diplomat in the region, however, said a deal was taking shape, but it would likely be limited in scope, involving the release of only a handful of hostages and a short pause in hostilities.

Such a truce and release would be only the second since the start of the war in October 2023.

The guarded optimism emerges as US President Joe Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan heads to Israel for talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday and then to Egypt and Qatar, co-mediators with the US on a deal.

Separately, President-elect Donald Trump has demanded that militants of the Palestinian Hamas group release the hostages held in Gaza before he takes over from Biden on Jan. 20. Otherwise, Trump has said, there will be “hell to pay.”

Trump's designated hostage envoy Adam Boehler has said he too is involved, having spoken already to Biden and to Netanyahu. Israel says 100 hostages remain captive in Gaza. Seven are believed to be US citizens.

Citing Trump's threat of "hell to pay," Boehler told Israel's Channel 13 news last week: "I would appeal to those people that have taken hostages: Make your best deal now. Make it now because every day that passes, it is going to get harder and harder and more Hamas lives will be lost."

Although Biden and Trump are working separately, their efforts overlap and both stand to gain from a deal. A US official said Trump's public statements about the need for a swift ceasefire “have not been harmful.”

The official said the priority is to get the hostages home, whether it is at the end of the Biden term or the start of the Trump term.

Steve Witkoff, Trump's designated Middle East envoy, met separately in late November with Netanyahu and Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said a source briefed on the talks.

TIMING IS APT FOR NETANYAHU

The timing for a deal may never have been better politically for Netanyahu.

The prime minister told reporters on Monday that Hamas' increasing isolation following the collapse of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad's rule opened the door to a possible hostage deal even if it was too early to claim success.

Israel's military chief and the head of the Shin Bet internal security service were in Cairo on Tuesday to discuss post-war Gaza border crossings and administration, according to three Israeli security sources.

The public optimism of Israeli leaders over the past week has matched the general tone in internal discussions behind closed doors, according to an Israeli official.

For Netanyahu, concessions would be far easier now with Israel having reestablished its reputation as the most powerful Middle East force and its Iran-backed enemies in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria now posing less of a threat.

Netanyahu's once-fragile coalition has been strengthened by the addition of Foreign Minister Gideon Saar and his more centrist faction. Netanyahu, having achieved a ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon, can complete the picture with the return of the hostages in a deal with Hamas.

Over the past year, some of the far-right ministers in his cabinet had voiced objections, even threatening to bring down the government, should the war in Gaza end. But with Israel's enemies weakened, and his coalition strengthened, Netanyahu is far less vulnerable politically.

Saar said on Monday that Israel was now more optimistic about a possible hostage deal amid reports Hamas had asked other Gaza factions to help it compile a list of Israeli and foreign hostages in their custody, whether dead or alive.

A Palestinian official close to the talks and familiar with the positions of all the parties involved described what he called "a fever of negotiations" with ideas emerging on all sides, including among mediators in Egypt and Qatar.

Trump's involvement had given the talks a boost, even if the sides have yet to present lists of Palestinian prisoners and hostages to be exchanged or to complete plans for a temporary or phased truce, the Palestinian official said.

He said Hamas was willing to show some flexibility should there be guarantees Israel would not resume the fighting.

It is unclear how the sides can bridge the largest gap that has persisted through numerous rounds of failed negotiations; Hamas demands an end to the war, while Israel says the war will not end before Hamas no longer rules Gaza.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken headed to Jordan and Turkey on Wednesday for talks on Syria, the State Department said. Israel is not in his official itinerary but there is always a possibility he might add the stop.

The United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly voted on Wednesday to demand an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas in the Gaza Strip and the immediate release of all hostages.

The ceasefire demand in the resolution - adopted with 158 votes in favour in the 193-member assembly - was expressed in more urgent language than one urging an immediate humanitarian truce in Gaza that the body "called for" in October 2023 then "demanded" in December 2023.

General Assembly resolutions are not binding but carry political weight, reflecting a global view on the war. The United States, Israel and seven other countries voted against the ceasefire resolution, while 13 countries abstained.

The world body also threw its support behind the UN Palestinian relief agency UNRWA, adopting a second resolution with 159 votes in favour to deplore a new Israeli law that will ban UNRWA's operations in Israel from late January.

It demanded that Israel respect UNRWA's mandate and "enable its operations to proceed without impediment or restriction." The US, Israel and seven other countries voted no, while 11 countries abstained.

"The messages we send to the world through these resolutions matter. And both of these resolutions have significant problems," Deputy US Ambassador to the UN Robert Wood told the assembly.

"One rewards Hamas and downplays the need to release the hostages, and the other denigrates Israel without providing a path forward to increasing humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians," he said.

Israel's UN Ambassador Danny Danon last week accused the UN of having "an obsession with vilifying Israel," while Palestinian UN envoy Riyad Mansour described Gaza as the "open, painful wound for the human family."

'HUNGER, DESPAIR, DEATH'

Israel says UNRWA staff took part in the Oct 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, which sparked the war in Gaza. The UN has said nine UNRWA staff may have been involved and had been fired. A Hamas commander in Lebanon - killed by Israel - was also found to have had an UNRWA job.

"By voting for these resolutions, you are not voting to protect humanitarian values, but to protect an organization that has become a haven for terror," Danon told the assembly on Wednesday before the vote.

UNRWA was established by the General Assembly in 1949 following the war surrounding the founding of Israel. The UN has repeatedly said there is no alternative to UNRWA, which provides aid, health and education to millions of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.

"Gaza doesn't exist anymore. It is destroyed. Palestinians are facing hunger, despair and death," Slovenia's UN Ambassador Samuel Zbogar told the assembly. "There is no reason for this war to continue. We need a ceasefire now. We need to bring hostages home now."

The war in the Palestinian enclave began after Hamas gunmen on Oct 7, 2023, stormed into Israeli communities, killing around 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages back to Hamas-run Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.

Since then, Israel's military has levelled swathes of Gaza, driving nearly all of its 2.3 million people from their homes, giving rise to deadly hunger and disease and killing more than 44,800 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, who do not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants.

The main commander of the fighters who toppled Bashar al-Assad said on Wednesday that he would dissolve the security forces of the former regime, close its prisons and hunt down anyone involved in the torture or killing of detainees.

Syrian rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa - better known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani - said in a statement to Reuters he will "dissolve the security forces of the previous regime and close the notorious prisons."

Syria ran one of the most oppressive police states in the Middle East during five decades of Assad family rule. Sharaa, whose former al Qaeda affiliate Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) is now the country's most powerful force, must balance demands for justice from victims with the need to prevent violent reprisals and secure international aid.

Syrians have flocked to the infamous prisons where the Assad regime is estimated to have held tens of thousands of detainees, desperately looking for their loved ones. Some have been released alive, others were identified among the dead and thousands more have not yet been found.

Sharaa said in a separate statement on the Syrian state TV's Telegram channel that people who took part in the torture or killing of detainees would be hunted down, and pardons were out of the question.

"We will pursue them in Syria, and we ask countries to hand over those who fled so we can achieve justice," said Sharaa.

The world is carefully watching to see if Syria's new rulers can stabilise the country and avoid unleashing violent revenge, after a 13-year civil war fought along sectarian and ethnic lines.

Since Assad's fall, 27-year-old Hayat al-Turki has been searching the abandoned cells of Syria's most notorious prison, the vast Sednaya complex, for any sign of her missing relatives, including her brother who vanished 14 years ago.

"I was hopeful and optimistic to find someone from my missing prisoners - a brother, an uncle or a cousin - but I did not... I searched the whole prison," she said.

Mohammad al-Bashir, the man installed by Sharaa's fighters to lead an interim administration until March, said he aimed to bring back millions of refugees, create unity and provide basic services.

But the new administration has scant resources, he told Italian newspaper Il Corriere della Sera.

"We have no foreign currency and as for loans and bonds we are still collecting data. So yes, financially we are very bad," said Bashir, who previously ran a small rebel-led administration in a pocket of northwestern Syria.

Rebuilding Syria is a colossal task following the civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of people, reduced cities to ruins and left the economy gutted by international sanctions. Millions of refugees still live in camps after one of the biggest displacements of modern times.

ENGAGING WARILY

Foreign officials are warily engaging with the former rebels, although HTS remains designated a terrorist organisation by Washington, the United Nations, EU and others.

The new government must "uphold clear commitments to fully respect the rights of minorities, facilitate the flow of humanitarian assistance to all in need, prevent Syria from being used as a base for terrorism or posing a threat to its neighbours," US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.

US Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer told Reuters Washington remains cautious.

"We have seen over the years any number of militant groups who have ... promised that they would govern in an inclusive way, and then see them fail to meet those promises," State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.

In addition to terrorism bans in place against the former rebels, Syria also remains under US, European and other financial sanctions imposed against Damascus under Assad.

Two senior US congressmen, a Republican and a Democrat, wrote a letter calling for Washington to suspend some sanctions. The most punishing war-time US sanctions are up for renewal this month, and the former rebels have told Reuters they are in touch with Washington about potentially easing them.

Spain's Foreign Minister Jose Luis Albares on Wednesday said at the Reuters NEXT conference that he expected the UN and European Union to discuss easing sanctions and removing HTS from lists of terrorist organisations.

The international community must quickly demand that the rebel forces transform into a political movement and respect human rights, he added.

"We must move very fast because in a month, probably, decisions will have already been taken in Damascus and we will not be able to have the impact that we can have today," Albares said.

With the administration of US President Joe Biden entering its final weeks in office, Blinken and US national security adviser Jake Sullivan headed to the Middle East on Wednesday to work on a Gaza ceasefire and help ensure a smooth transition in Syria, US officials said. Their separate itineraries include stops in Jordan, Turkey, Israel, Qatar and Egypt.

For refugees, the prospect of returning home has brought a mixture of joy and grief over hardship in exile. Syrians lined up at the Turkish border on Wednesday to head home, speaking of their expectations for a better life following what was for many a decade of hardship in Turkey.

"We have no one here. We are going back to Latakia, where we have family," said Mustafa as he prepared to enter Syria with his wife and three sons at the Cilvegozu border gate in southern Turkey. Dozens more Syrians were waiting to cross.

The insurgents seize the last remaining junta-controlled border outpost, the BGP-5 battalion near Maungdaw

The Arakan Army (AA), a rebel group in Myanmar, has reportedly captured the town of Maungdaw in Rakhine state amid the ongoing conflict with government forces.

Consequently, the entirety of the 270km Bangladesh-Myanmar border is now under the control of the AA, according to a BBC report.

The insurgents seized the last remaining junta-controlled border outpost, the BGP-5 battalion near Maungdaw, on Dec 8 following months of intense fighting.

Videos released by the AA show their forces besieging the outpost with heavy gunfire, while Myanmar’s air force launched counterattacks.

Since the military coup in 2021, which ousted Myanmar’s democratically elected government, the country has been embroiled in a devastating civil war. The AA has been actively fighting the junta for over eight months.

Security analysts note that some Rohingya-aligned groups in Rakhine, including the Arakan Rohingya Army (ARA) and the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), initially sided with the junta. However, the latest defeat marks another significant setback for coup leader Gen Min Aung Hlaing, as the junta continues to lose strategic towns to the AA.

Earlier this year, military units, including the BGP-5 battalion, were withdrawn from Maungdaw in September. The compound, spanning approximately 20 hectares, was built on land formerly occupied by the Rohingya village of Maung Thugyi, which was burned and cleared during the military’s violent crackdown on the Rohingya in 2017.

The scale of the fighting in Maungdaw since June suggests that the junta has suffered heavy losses, with reports of hundreds of soldiers killed. On Dec 7, the AA announced the capture of over 30 junta military camps in Rakhine’s Ann Township, repelling air and ground attacks.

Reports indicate that Myanmar soldiers began surrendering in Maungdaw. Videos from the AA show soldiers emerging with white flags, many injured or limping. Inside the outpost, footage reveals the devastation, with piles of bodies and AA fighters celebrating their victory.

The AA claimed that over 450 junta soldiers were killed during the Maungdaw siege. They released images of captured Brig Gen Thurein Tun and other officers kneeling beneath a raised AA banner.

Pro-military commentators in Myanmar have expressed despair on social media following the fall of BGP-5, underscoring the AA's growing strength and effectiveness.

Although the AA was established relatively late, in 2009, it has emerged as one of Myanmar’s most formidable rebel forces. However, questions remain about how the group will treat the approximately 600,000 Rohingya still living in Rakhine, especially after the military expelled over 700,000 Rohingya in 2017.

A Rohingya man who recently fled Maungdaw to Bangladesh described widespread destruction. "Eighty per cent of the housing in Maungdaw and the surrounding villages has been destroyed," one Rohingya man who left Maungdaw recently for Bangladesh told the BBC.

"The town is deserted. Almost all the shops and houses have been looted."

Relations between the AA and the Rohingya population have long been strained, and tensions have escalated further. Many Rohingya groups in Bangladesh refugee camps initially aligned with the junta and are now in a precarious position.

The AA has also targeted Rohingya militias tied to the junta, including the ARA, ARSA, and the Rohingya Solidarity Organisation, forcing them to abandon their bases.

Earlier this year, leaders of some Rohingya groups sought refuge in Bangladesh with weapons but were detained by local authorities.

The Myanmar government continues to deny the Rohingya citizenship, and many in Rakhine believe they should not remain in the region. A Rohingya man said, "Our situation today is even more difficult than it was under the rule of the military junta."

President-elect Donald Trump is now considering tapping Richard Grenell, his former intelligence chief, to be a special envoy for Iran, according to two people familiar with the transition plans.

"He's definitely in the running," said a person familiar with transition deliberations, who asked not to be identified.

No final decisions on either personnel or strategy on Iran have been made official yet by Trump, including whether to slap fresh sanctions on the country, pursue diplomacy or both in order to halt their nuclear program.

Trump's plans for the role have not previously been reported. Neither Trump's team nor Grenell responded to requests for comment.

"Richard Grenell is a fabulous person, A STAR. He will be someplace, high up!" Trump said in a post on his social media platform late Wednesday following the Reuters report.

Grenell, in a separate post on X, called the report "wrong" but gave no other details.

Still, Trump's consideration of a key ally for such a posting sends a signal to the region that the new US president may be open to talks with a country he has previously threatened and whose elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps have sought to assassinate him, according to the US government. Iran has denied the claim.

In the role, Grenell is expected to be tasked with speaking with countries in and beyond the region about the Iran issue as well as taking Tehran's temperature on possible negotiations, said one of the people.

Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian, who is viewed as relatively moderate, said following Trump's election that Tehran must "deal with the US" and "manage" relations with its arch-foe.

Iran has suffered a series of strategic setbacks, including Israel's assault on Tehran's proxy militias Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon and the ouster of Iranian ally Bashar al-Assad in Syria.

But tensions remain high more than a year after Hamas attacked southern Israel, launching the Gaza war. Meanwhile, other Iranian proxies have attacked US, Israeli and other Western targets, and Tehran has accelerated its nuclear program while limiting the UN nuclear watchdog's ability to monitor it.

It's not the first job Trump has considered for Grenell, who served as Trump's ambassador to Germany, a special presidential envoy for Serbia and Kosovo peace negotiations, and as acting director of national intelligence during Trump's 2017-2021 term.

After campaigning for Trump in the lead up to the Nov 5 election, he was a top contender to be secretary of state and for special envoy for the Ukraine war. Those jobs went to US Senator Marco Rubio and retired lieutenant general Keith Kellogg, respectively. Trump takes office next month.

During his first term in office, in 2020, Trump ordered a US air strike that killed Iran's top military commander, Qassem Soleimani.

Trump in 2018 also reneged on a nuclear deal struck by his predecessor Barack Obama in 2015 and re-imposed US economic sanctions on Iran that had been relaxed. The deal had limited Iran's ability to enrich uranium, a process that can yield fissile material for nuclear weapons.

Iran now is "dramatically" accelerating enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% level that is weapons grade, the UN nuclear watchdog chief told Reuters last week. Iran says its nuclear program only serves peaceful purposes.

US President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said he was picking Kari Lake, a former news anchor and a hardline Republican who failed to win an Arizona Senate seat last month, to be the director of US government-funded media outlet Voice of America.

Trump, in a post on his Truth Social site, said Lake will "ensure that the American values of Freedom and Liberty are broadcast around the World FAIRLY and ACCURATELY, unlike the lies spread by the Fake News Media."

Lake, a strong Trump supporter who has echoed his false claims about fraud at the 2020 election, also lost the governor's race in swing state Arizona in 2022 and was previously an anchor at Phoenix-based Fox 10.

Voice of America (VOA) is an international media broadcaster that operates in more than 40 languages online and on radio and television.

During his first term in office, Trump clashed with VOA and accused it of amplifying Chinese propaganda after it showed a segment on a light show marking the reopening of Wuhan, the city where the coronavirus pandemic first emerged.

Israel killed 13 Palestinians in two airstrikes in Gaza on Thursday that Gaza medics and Hamas said were part of a force protecting humanitarian aid trucks. Israel's military said they were Hamas militants trying to hijack the shipment.

Many of those killed in the attacks on Rafah and Khan Younis in southern Gaza had links to Hamas, according to sources close to the group. The 13 were among 36 Palestinians killed in separate Israeli attacks on Thursday, the medics said.

The Israeli military said in a statement the two airstrikes aimed to ensure the safe delivery of humanitarian aid and accused Hamas members of planning to prevent the aid from reaching Gaza civilians who need it.

The statement said the Hamas members aimed to hijack the aid "in support of continuing terrorist activity".

Armed gangs have repeatedly hijacked aid trucks after they roll into the enclave, and Hamas has formed a task force to confront them. The Hamas-led forces have killed over two dozen members of the gangs in recent months, Hamas sources and medics said.

The Palestinian news agency WAFA said those killed in the two airstrikes were guarding the aid trucks.

Hamas said Israeli military strikes have killed at least 700 police tasked with securing aid trucks in Gaza since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023. It has accused Israel of trying to protect acts of looting and "creating anarchy and chaos to prevent aid from reaching the people of Gaza".

Later on Thursday, the Israeli military ordered residents of several districts in the heart of Gaza City to evacuate, citing new rocket launches from those areas that it would respond to.

"This is a pre-warning before an attack," read the military statement posted on X. The warning was also channeled to some residents through audio and written text on their mobile phones.

The evacuation orders caused a new wave of displacement. At nightfall, dozens of families streamed out of the areas heading toward the center of the city.

ISRAELI STRIKES IN GAZA CITY, CENTRAL GAZA

Children were among seven people killed when a residential building in Gaza City's al-Jalaa Street was bombed in a separate attack, WAFA said.

Another Israeli bombing killed 15 people in a house where displaced people were taking shelter, west of Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip, medics and WAFA said.

In the northern Gaza refugee camp of Jabalia, where the army has operated since October, health officials said an orthopedic doctor, Saeed Judeh, was shot dead by Israeli forces while on his way to Al-Awda Hospital where he usually treated patients.

The health ministry said his death raised to 1,057 the number of healthcare workers killed since the war began.

Months of ceasefire efforts by Arab mediators, Egypt and Qatar, backed by the United States, have failed to conclude a deal between the two warring sides.

On Wednesday, the United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly voted to demand an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire and the immediate release of all hostages seized in Israel in October 2023 and held by Hamas in Gaza.

The war in the Palestinian enclave began after Hamas gunmen stormed into Israeli communities, killing around 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages back to Hamas-run Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.

Since then, Israel's military has leveled swathes of Gaza, driving nearly all of its 2.3 million people from their homes, giving rise to deadly hunger and disease and killing more than 44,800 people, according to Palestinian health authorities.

In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where violence has surged since the Gaza war began, Israeli forces shot dead two Palestinians, at least one of them a militant, in separate raids in Nablus and Qalqilya, Palestinian and Israeli officials said.

Around 810 Palestinians, including many militants and civilians, have been killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank since October 2023.

US President-elect Donald Trump in an interview published on Thursday said he will be talking to Robert F Kennedy Jr, his nominee to run the Department of Health and Human Services, about ending childhood vaccination programmes.

When asked if he would sign off if Kennedy decided to end childhood vaccinations programmes, Trump told Time magazine, "we're going to have a big discussion. The autism rate is at a level that nobody ever believed possible. If you look at things that are happening, there's something causing it."

When asked if the discussion could result in his administration getting rid of some vaccinations, Trump said: "It could if I think it's dangerous, if I think they are not beneficial, but I don't think it's going to be very controversial in the end."

Asked in the Nov 25 interview if he thinks childhood autism is linked to vaccines, Trump said: "No, I'm going to be listening to Bobby," referring to Kennedy. Trump said he had a lot of respect for Kennedy and his views on vaccinations.

Kennedy, who opposed state and federal COVID-19 restrictions and was accused of spreading misinformation about the virus, has for years sown doubts over the safety and efficacy of vaccines, including asserting a debunked link between vaccines and autism.

Trump has suggested in the past that vaccines might be linked to autism. "I want to see the numbers," he said. "At the end of the studies that we're doing, and we're going all out, we're going to know what's good and what's not good."

RETRACTED AND DISCREDITED

Many of the claims that vaccines cause autism can be traced to a retracted 1998 study published in medical journal The Lancet. The paper, written by British doctor Andrew Wakefield, has been widely discredited.

Research, including a 2014 meta-analysis of studies involving more than 1.2 million children, found no association between vaccines and autism.

Autism advocacy group Autism Speaks says it "remains aligned with the scientific consensus, which confirms that vaccines do not cause autism."

Former FDA commissioner and current Pfizer board member Scott Gottlieb has said if Kennedy follows through on his intentions to end vaccine mandates "it will cost lives in this country.”

He said lower vaccination rates could lead to large outbreaks of once nearly eradicated diseases like measles. "For every 1,000 cases of measles that occur in children, there will be one death. And we are not good in this country at diagnosing and treating measles,” Gottlieb told CNBC last month.

Kennedy disputes the anti-vaccine tag, but chaired the Children’s Health Defence, a nonprofit organization that focuses on anti-vaccine messaging.

"He (Kennedy) does not disagree with vaccinations, all vaccinations. He disagrees probably with some," Trump said.

If he is confirmed to run HHS, Kennedy would oversee the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, which controls what vaccines are recommended for Americans and when they should receive them. It also runs the Vaccines for Children programme that provides free vaccines for some children.

The remarks are in line with a comment Trump made in an interview with Meet The Press on Sunday in which he said that the potential risks from vaccines should be studied.

"I think vaccines are — certain vaccines — are incredible. But maybe some aren’t. And if they aren’t, we have to find out," he said.

During a presidential debate in his 2016 White House campaign, Trump appeared to embrace the debunked autism link. He said he was "totally in favour of vaccines," but suggested spreading out recommended inoculations over a longer period of time. "And I think you're going to have, I think you're going to see a big impact on autism."

Outgoing US President Joe Biden said on Thursday that he was pardoning 39 people convicted of non-violent crimes and commuting the sentences of nearly 1,500 others who were serving long prison terms.

The moves come over a week after the president signed an unconditional pardon for his son Hunter.

Officials said last week that the White House was listening to demands for Biden to extend the same grace to thousands of people wronged by the US judicial system.

The commutations on Thursday were announced for those who were placed on home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Biden said these people would have received shorter sentences if charged under today's laws, policies and practices.

Sources had told Reuters last week that the pardons being discussed included those convicted of nonviolent drug offenses and people identified by civil rights groups as unjustly incarcerated.

"As president, I have the great privilege of extending mercy to people who have demonstrated remorse and rehabilitation, restoring opportunity for Americans to participate in daily life and contribute to their communities, and taking steps to remove sentencing disparities for non-violent offenders, especially those convicted of drug offenses," Biden said.

The president added that he will take more steps in the weeks ahead and that his administration will continue reviewing clemency petitions.

US Rep Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, one of the leading Democrats behind a letter to Biden last month urging him to issue clemency to Americans with nonviolent offenses, commended the president for taking "meaningful and historic action."

Her statement noted that he could take further steps to exercise his power during his remaining 39 days in office.

The White House said that the clemencies granted by Biden were the most ever in a single day.

The list primarily includes Americans placed under home confinement during the Covid-19 pandemic to mitigate the spread of the virus, experts say, rather than many individuals civil rights groups have been advocating for.

"We do think he can pardon more people - specifically people who are currently incarcerated and might have lower sentences if they were convicted today," said Tierra Bradford, senior program manager at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.

US President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has saidthat he would act on his first day in office to pardon rioters involved in the Jan 6, 2021, Capitol attack, further building expectations for a broad granting of clemency.

The US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed listing the monarch butterfly as a threatened species on Tuesday, citing a significant decline in the iconic black and orange insects that has pushed them toward extinction.

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

Monarch butterflies, known for migrating thousands of miles (km) across North America, have experienced a decades-long U.S. population decline due to habitat loss caused by human activities such as farming and urban development, widespread use of pesticides and climate change.

Environmental groups have been pushing for US protection of the winged pollinators for a decade.

KEY QUOTE

"The iconic monarch butterfly is cherished across North America, captivating children and adults throughout its fascinating lifecycle," US FWS Director Martha Williams said in a statement.

"Despite its fragility, it is remarkably resilient, like many things in nature when we just give them a chance. Science shows that the monarch needs that chance, and this proposed listing invites and builds on unprecedented public participation in shaping monarch conservation efforts," she added

CONTEXT

Despite being recognised as needing federal protection under the Endangered Species Act four years ago, the monarch butterfly waited behind dozens of other species facing more immediate threats.

The ESA, signed into law in 1973, is credited with helping to save the bald eagle, California condor and numerous other animals and plants from extinction. ESA protection makes it illegal to kill or harm species classified as threatened or endangered without a special permit.

BY THE NUMBERS

The eastern migratory monarch population has declined by about 80% since the 1980s, while the western migratory population has dropped by more than 95%. The declines put the western populations at greater than 99% chance of extinction by 2080, according to the FWS.

The agency is proposing to designate 4,395 acres (1,780 hectares) in California as "critical habitat" for the butterflies. Federal agencies are prohibited from destroying or modifying areas with that designation.

WHAT'S NEXT

The public will have until March 12, 2025 to comment on the proposal to list the monarch butterfly. The service will then evaluate the comments and any additional information on the species to determine whether to list the monarch butterfly.

Environment ministry urges mask use for those venturing outside amid alarming air quality

The air quality in Dhaka and its surrounding areas has fluctuated between "unhealthy" and "hazardous," prompting the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change to advise individuals at risk to avoid going outside unless necessary.

The ministry recommended using masks for anyone needing to step outdoors in these conditions in a statement on Tuesday.

Citizens were also urged to monitor the environment department’s website for regular updates and take appropriate precautions.

Data from international air quality monitoring platform IQAir showed that Dhaka’s Air Quality Index, or AQI, stood at 193 at 6pm on Tuesday, categorised as "unhealthy."

At that time, Dhaka ranked second among cities with the worst air quality globally.

The AQI worsened after 10pm, remaining above 200—sometimes even exceeding 300—through to the following afternoon.

Air quality levels depend on the concentration of fine particulate matter, such as PM10 and PM2.5, measured in micrograms per cubic metre.

Other pollutants like sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ground-level ozone also contribute to the AQI.

An AQI score of 51-100 is considered "moderate" or "acceptable."

Scores between 101-150 are "unhealthy for sensitive groups."

Scores between 151-200 indicate "unhealthy" air.

Scores of 201-300 represent "very unhealthy" conditions.

Anything above 300 is deemed "hazardous" or "disastrous."

According to the environment department’s AQI data, Dhaka's air quality has mostly remained above 150 since Oct 12, except for 12 days when it dropped below this level.

During this 59-day period, the AQI exceeded 200 on 13 days.

Last Thursday, Dhaka's AQI hit 335.

To combat air pollution, the environment ministry has issued directives to halt the burning of solid waste, install covers and enclosures at construction sites, transport construction materials under covers, spray water at least twice daily around such sites, and bar the use of old or smoke-producing vehicles on the roads.

Brick kiln operators, factory owners, and the public have also been urged to comply with these measures.

The ministry emphasised that tackling air pollution requires collaborative efforts from the government and citizens.

Workers in some of the world's biggest garment manufacturing hubs in Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Pakistan are increasingly exposed to extreme heat as climate change pushes temperatures up, a report found on Sunday, a problem multinational retailers and brands will have to help address.

New European Union regulations make retailers selling in the bloc, like Inditex, H&M and Nike, legally liable for conditions at their suppliers, putting pressure on them to help fund improvements to cool factories they source from.

In Dhaka, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Phnom Penh and Karachi, the number of days with "wet-bulb" temperatures - a measurement that accounts for air temperature as well as humidity - above 30.5 degrees Celsius jumped by 42% in 2020-2024 compared to 2005-2009, researchers at Cornell University's Global Labor Institute found.

Above that threshold, the International Labor Organisation recommends as much rest as work in any given hour to maintain safe core body temperature levels.

The report identified only three retailers - Nike, Levi's, and VF Corp - which specifically include protocols to protect workers from heat exhaustion in their supplier codes of conduct.

COMPANIES WARNED

"We've been talking to brands for ages now about this issue, and they're only now starting to turn their attention to it," Jason Judd, executive director at Cornell University's Global Labor Institute, told Reuters.

"If a brand or retailer knows that temperatures in a production area are excessively high or doing damage to worker health, then they're obligated under this new set of rules to do something about it," he added.

The EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive came into force in July and will start applying to large companies from mid-2027.

Fixes to cool factories could include better ventilation and water evaporative cooling systems, instead of energy-intensive and expensive air conditioning that would increase manufacturers' carbon emissions.

Some factory owners would likely be willing to make such investments themselves, given how heat stress significantly impacts productivity, Judd said, but the EU rules highlight brands' responsibility to address the issue too.

The report also urged retailers and brands to invest in higher wages and health protections so that workers can manage the risk of missing work days due to heatwaves.

Extreme heat and flooding could erase $65 billion in apparel export earnings from Bangladesh, Cambodia, Pakistan and Vietnam by 2030, research from asset manager Schroders and the Global Labor Institute found last year.

Title: 2024 will be the hottest year on record, EU scientists say

The data comes two weeks after a $300bn deal to tackle climate change, a package poorer countries blasted as insufficient

This year will be the world's warmest since records began, with extraordinarily high temperatures expected to persist into at least the first few months of 2025, European Union scientists said on Monday.

The data from the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) comes two weeks after UN climate talks yielded a $300-billion deal to tackle climate change, a package poorer countries blasted as insufficient to cover the soaring cost of climate-related disasters.

C3S said data from January to November had confirmed 2024 is now certain to be the hottest year on record, and the first in which average global temperatures exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period.

The previous hottest year on record was 2023.

Extreme weather has swept around the world in 2024, with severe drought hitting Italy and South America, fatal floods in Nepal, Sudan and Europe, heatwaves in Mexico, Mali and Saudi Arabia that killed thousands, and disastrous cyclones in the US and the Philippines.

Scientific studies have confirmed the fingerprints of human-caused climate change on all of these disasters.

Last month ranked as the second-warmest November on record after November 2023.

"We're still in near-record-high territory for global temperatures, and that's likely to stay at least for the next few months," Copernicus climate researcher Julien Nicolas told Reuters.

Carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels are the main cause of climate change.

Cutting emissions to net zero - as many governments have pledged to eventually do - will stop global warming from getting worse. Yet despite these green pledges, global CO2 emissions are set to hit a record high this year.

Scientists are also monitoring whether the La Nina weather pattern - which involves the cooling of ocean surface temperatures - could form in 2025.

That could briefly cool global temperatures, though it would not halt the long-term underlying trend of warming caused by emissions. The world is currently in neutral conditions, after El Nino - La Nina's hotter counterpart - ended earlier this year.

"While 2025 might be slightly cooler than 2024, if a La Nina event develops, this does not mean temperatures will be 'safe' or 'normal'," said Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer at Imperial College London.

"We will still experience high temperatures, resulting in dangerous heatwaves, droughts, wildfires and tropical cyclones."

C3S' records go back to 1940, and are cross-checked with global temperature records going back to 1850.

The United Nations' top court on Monday starts hearings on the legal obligation of countries to fight climate change and the consequences for states of contributing to global warming, the outcome of which could influence litigation worldwide.

Vanuatu, one of the small island states that spearheaded the effort to get the International Court of Justice to give a so-called advisory opinion, will be the first of over a hundred states and international organisations to give their views in two weeks of proceedings starting at 10am (0900 GMT).

While the court's advisory opinions are not binding, they are legally and politically significant. Experts say the court's eventual opinion on climate change will likely be cited in climate change-driven lawsuits in courts from Europe to Latin America and beyond.

The hearings begin a week after developing nations denounced as woefully inadequate an agreement reached at the COP29 summit for countries to provide $300 billion in annual climate finance by 2035 to help poorer nations cope with climate change.

Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu's special envoy for climate change and the environment, said it was imperative fossil fuels be phased out and more money provided to poorer nations bearing the brunt of climate change, such as his Pacific island nation.

"We would like cumulative historical emissions that cause significant harm to the climate system to be declared unlawful," Regenvanu told Reuters.

Aside from small island states and numerous Western and developing countries, the court will also hear from the world's top two emitters of greenhouse gases, the United States and China. Oil producer group OPEC will also give its views.

The hearings will run until Dec 13. The court's opinion is expected to be delivered in 2025.

Restoring the world's degraded land and holding back its deserts will require at least $2.6 trillion in investment by the end of the decade, the UN executive overseeing global talks on the issue told Reuters, quantifying the cost for the first time.

More frequent and severe droughts as a result of climate change combined with the food needs of a rising population meant societies were at greater risk of upheaval unless action was taken, Ibrahim Thiaw said ahead of talks in Riyadh this week.

The two-week meeting aims to strengthen the world's drought resilience, including by toughening up the legal obligations of states, laying out strategic next steps and securing finance.

A large chunk of the around $1 billion a day that is required will need to come from the private sector, said Thiaw, who is Executive Secretary of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, or UNCCD.

"The bulk of the investments on land restoration in the world is coming from public money. And that is not right. Because essentially the main driver of land degradation in the world is food production... which is in the hands of the private sector," Thiaw said, adding that as of now it provides only 6 percent of the money needed to rehabilitate damaged land.

"How come that one hand is degrading the land and the other hand has the charge of restoring it and repairing it?," said Thiaw, whilst acknowledging the responsibility of governments to set and enforce good land-use policies and regulations.

With a growing population meaning that the world needs to produce twice as much food on the same amount of land, private sector investment would be critical, he said.

The talks in Saudi Arabia follow similar UN events in October on biodiversity and in November on climate change and plastics, where finance - or the lack of it - played a central role.

To hit $2.6 trillion - approaching the annual economic output of France - the world needs to close an annual gap of $278 billion, after just $66 billion was invested in 2022, the UN said.

LONG PROCESS

A UN-backed study released on Sunday said land degradation was "undermining Earth's capacity to sustain humanity" and failure to reverse it would "pose challenges for generations".

Land totalling around 15 million square kilometres - bigger than Antarctica - was already degraded, and was growing by about 1 million square kilometres each year, it added.

Getting agreement on hardening up the legal obligations of states, though, will be among the tougher deals to strike, Thiaw said, adding that some countries were "not ready to have another legally binding instrument" while others felt it was important.

While countries had already made commitments to protect around 900 million hectares of land, they needed to set a more ambitious target of 1.5 billion hectares and speed up the pace.

Failure to agree on steps to restore degraded land would ultimately hurt parallel UN-led efforts to rein in climate-damaging greenhouse gas emissions and protect biodiversity, Thiaw said, with agriculture accounting for 23 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, 80 percent of deforestation and 70 percent of freshwater use.

"The resources that we are talking about are not charity," Thiaw said, adding: "So it is important that we see this not as an investment for poor Africans, but as an investment that will keep the world balanced."
