Title: U-19 Women's Asia Cup: Bangladesh breeze past Nepal to set up final clash with India

The Tigresses beat Nepal by 9 wickets in Kuala Lumpur

Bangladesh have trounced Nepal by 9 wickets to secure a berth in the final of the Under-19 Women’s Asia Cup.

On Friday, the young Tigresses bounced back in style from their earlier loss to India in the Super Four stage opener in Kuala Lumpur.

In a rain-curtailed 11-over game, Nepal managed just 54 runs, which Bangladesh chased down comfortably in 9.5 overs.

Bangladesh will face India in the final on Sunday at the same venue.

After winning the toss, Bangladesh opted to field and immediately put pressure on Nepal. A combination of tight bowling and poor running between the wickets left Nepal struggling. Three of their first four wickets were run-outs within the first six overs.

Nepal's highest partnership was a 19-run stand between captain Puja Mahato and Sabitri Dhami for the second wicket. Dhami, the only batter to reach double figures, scored 11 off 12 balls.

Farjana Easmin, Anisa Akter, Fahomida Choya, and Habiba Islam chipped in with a wicket apiece for Bangladesh.

Chasing a modest target, openers Fahomida and Mosammat Eva got the Tigresses off to a flying start. Fahmida struck boundaries in consecutive overs, while Eva hit the only six of the match in the fifth over.

The opening partnership of 46 runs ended in the eighth over when Eva was bowled by Kusum Godar for 18 off 21 balls. However, Fahomida guided her team across the finish line with an unbeaten 26 off 32 balls, alongside Sumaiya Akhter, who added 10 runs off six balls.

Fahomida was named Player of the Match for her all-round performance.

Match Summary:

Nepal U-19: 54/8 in 11 overs (Dhami 11, Mahato 9; Farzana 1/13, Anisa 1/10, Fahomida 1/14, Habiba 1/11)

Bangladesh U-19: 58/1 in 9.5 overs (Fahomida 26*, Eva 18, Sumaiya 10*)

Result: Bangladesh won by 9 wickets.

Player of the Match: Fahomida Choya



Title: Bangladesh crush West Indies by 80 runs to complete T20 series sweep

After setting a daunting target of 190, the visitors bundle out the Caribbean side for 109 runs to win the third T20

Bangladesh have romped to a resounding 80-run win in the third and final T20 match against the West Indies to sweep the series 3-0. This is Bangladesh's biggest win in T20Is against the Caribbean side.

The Tigers had only achieved whitewashes in T20 series twice before: against England at home last year and against Ireland away in 2012.

However, this victory carries extra significance. Coming on the heels of a disappointing ODI series whitewash, and achieved without key players like regular captain Najmul Hossain Shanto, Towhid Hridoy, and Mustafizur Rahman, the triumph marks a memorable end to a challenging year for Bangladesh cricket.

The match in St Vincent on Friday morning Bangladesh time saw Parvez Hossain Emon returning to the side and giving the team a solid start with the bat. Jaker Ali then stole the show with a blistering knock, helping the visitors post a commanding total of 189 runs in their 20 overs.

In reply, the West Indies collapsed for just 109 runs to hand a remarkable victory to Bangladesh.

Jaker lit up the match with a breathtaking 72* off just 41 balls, smashing six sixes and displaying incredible skill, power, and match awareness. Earlier in the tour, he impressed with two brilliant Test innings and solid ODI performances. He capped off the T20 series by dismantling the West Indies bowlers with ease.

Once Jaker set the tone, the Bangladeshi bowlers completed the job with minimal fuss. Rishad Hossain, who has had an outstanding year, posted his career-best figures of 3 wickets for 21 runs. Taskin Ahmed, Mahedi Hasan, and Hasan Mahmud also bowled with precision and rhythm to put the squeeze on one of the most dangerous teams in cricket's shortest format.

DOMINANT START

After winning toss and electing to bat, Bangladesh dominated from the get-go in Kingstown. Parvez, stepping in for the injured Soumya Sarkar, began with a classy boundary and soon showcased his power hitting. Alongside skipper Litton Das, he put up a brisk opening stand of 40 runs in the first four overs.

However, Litton’s promising start, highlighted by three elegant boundaries, ended in disappointment as he was dismissed for a run-a-ball 13. Parvez followed soon after, falling for a quickfire 39 off 20 balls, including four boundaries and two sixes.

The momentum slowed after Tanzid Hasan’s brief cameo, where he struck a six before being dismissed. The Tigers managed only 36 runs between the fifth and 10th overs. Mehidy Hasan Miraz attempted to hit the accelerator, scoring a handy 29 off 22 balls, but his innings ended prematurely.

Then came Jaker's moment. Starting cautiously with just 10 runs off 13 balls, he switched gears in the 14th over with a slog-swept six off Gudakesh Motie. Surviving a near run-out, Jaker took complete control, dominating the West Indies bowlers. His range of shots cleared every part of the ground—long-on, mid-wicket, and extra cover.

Despite quick dismissals of Shamim Hossain (2) and Mahedi (0), Jaker continued the onslaught. In the last five overs, he smashed five sixes and two boundaries, including a colossal 95-metre six off Obed McCoy. He brought up his fifty in style with a boundary off Alzarri Joseph and finished the innings by hammering three sixes in a 25-run final over as Bangladesh ended with a commanding total of 189 for 6.

CLINICAL BOWLING DISPLAY

Defending the target, Bangladesh struck early. Taskin bowled an outswinger followed by an inswinger to trap Brandon King leg-before for a duck in the first over.

Mahedi then dismissed debutant Justin Greaves in the second over. While Johnson Charles and Nicholas Pooran counterattacked briefly, adding 34 runs in three overs, Bangladesh hit back quickly. Mahedi dismissed Pooran (15 off 10) for the third time in the series, and Hasan Mahmud kept Roston Chase scoreless. Rishad’s brilliant direct hit ran out Charles (18 off 23), and soon after, he dismissed Rovman Powell with the ball.

The West Indies collapsed, losing four wickets for just 14 runs, leaving them teetering at 60/6. Romario Shepherd tried to rescue his side with a spirited 33 off 27 balls, but his efforts only helped the hosts cross 100 as Bangladesh cruised to a comprehensive victory.

Brief Score:

Bangladesh: 189/7 in 20 overs (Litton 14, Parvez 39, Tanzid 9, Miraz 29, Jaker 72* (41 balls, 6 sixes), Shamim 2, Mahedi 0, Tanzim 17, Rishad 0*; Shepherd 4-0-30-2, Joseph 4-0-59-1, Chase 4-0-15-1, Motie 3-0-30-1)

West Indies: 109 in 16.4 overs (King 0, Charles 23, Greaves 6, Pooran 15, Chase 0, Powell 2, Shepherd 33, Akeal 31, Motie 12, Joseph 1, McCoy 5, Seales 4*; Rishad 4-0-21-3, Taskin 3.4-0-30-2, Mahedi 3-0-13-2, Hasan 3-0-9-1, Tanzim 3-0-31-1)

Result: Bangladesh won by 80 runs

Series result: Bangladesh won the 3-match series 3-0

Player of the Match: Jaker Ali

Player of the Series: Mahedi Hasan



Title: Afghanistan enjoy record ODI win helped by Atal ton against Zimbabwe

They have scored 286-6, led by Atal's 104 and Malik's 84

Afghanistan recorded their biggest One-Day International victory with a 232-run win against hosts Zimbabwe after opener Sediqullah Atal's maiden ODI century and figures of 3-9 by off-spinner AM Ghazanfar at the Harare Sports Club on Thursday.

After being sent in to bat, Afghanistan amassed 286 for six in their 50 overs, led by Atal’s 104 from 128 balls as part of an opening stand of 191 with Abdul Malik (84 from 101 balls).

Zimbabwe struggled from the start of their reply and were bowled out for 54, the joint lowest Afghanistan have dismissed a side for in ODI cricket. It matches the score they skittled Zimbabwe for at the same venue in 2017.

Afghanistan have a 1-0 lead after two matches in the three-game series with the first fixture rained out. The third and final game is at the Harare Sports Club on Saturday.



Title: India hope misfiring top order will come good after Gabba jailbreak

They snatched a draw in the rain-blighted third Test in Brisbane

A jailbreak at the Gabba has brought a palpable sense of relief in the India camp, while giving rise to hope their misfiring top order will finally come good in more batting-friendly conditions in the final two Tests against Australia.

India snatched a draw in the rain-blighted third Test in Brisbane despite yet another top order debacle that left them reeling at 74-5 in reply to Australia's 445.

Number seven batter Ravindra Jadeja inspired a spirited rearguard action and India's final pair of Akash Deep and Jasprit Bumrah combined in a 47-run partnership to stave off follow-on.

While India managed to keep the five-Test series level at 1-1 heading into the Boxing day test in Melbourne, the fragility of their top order remains a major concern for the tourists.

In five completed innings so far in the series, only once have India managed an opening stand of more than 12 runs.

The lone exception came in the second innings of the series opener in Perth where Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul forged a 201-run partnership to set up their comprehensive victory.

The poor starts meant on three out of those five occasions, India posted sub-200 scores, including twice in the day-night second Test in Adelaide, which Australia won by 10 wickets.

There is a growing feeling in the camp, though, that the worst is behind them and that batting will be easier in the last two tests in Melbourne and Sydney.

"Whatever happened today, it gave us confidence ahead of Melbourne," India captain Rohit Sharma told reporters on Wednesday.

"We're aware we have to start from scratch, conditions are different there and the ball may not move around so much there like it did here."

Rohit's own struggle with form is symptomatic of the greater malaise afflicting the Indian top order.

The 37-year-old, who missed the opening Test to be with his newborn son in Mumbai, has just one fifty in his last 13 test innings.

The opener has moved down to the middle order in his bid to regain form but managed a highest score of 10 in three innings.

"I have not batted well, there is no harm in accepting that," Rohit said, denying he was feeling under pressure.

"As long as my mind, my body and my feet are moving well, I'm pretty happy with how things are panning out for me."

India need to win both matches to make the World Test Championship (WTC) final for the third time in a row without having to rely on other results.

Champions Australia need two wins and a draw in their next four tests, which include two in Sri Lanka, to be sure of qualification.



Title: Maharaj out of Pakistan ODIs, doubt for crucial Test series

South Africa are top of the World Test Championship table and need victory in one of their two remaining matches against Pakistan

First choice spinner Keshav Maharaj has been ruled out of the remaining two One-Day Internationals against Pakistan and is a doubt for the crucial two-Test home series against the sub-continent side that starts on Dec 26.

Maharaj has a left adductor strain and will miss the 50-over fixtures in Cape Town on Thursday and Johannesburg on Sunday, but of much greater concern will be the 34-year-old’s availability for the Test series.

South Africa are top of the World Test Championship table and need victory in one of their two remaining matches against Pakistan to guarantee a place at the Lord’s final in June next year.

Should Maharaj be unavailable, the only specialist spinner in the Test squad is the less experienced Senuran Muthusamy. Bjorn Fortuin has been named as his replacement for the final two ODIs.



Title: India-Pakistan matches at ICC events to be held at neutral venues

Due to soured relations, India have not visited Pakistan since 2008 and the rivals play each other only at multi-team events

Matches between politically-estranged rivals India and Pakistan at ICC events that either nation is due to host will be played at neutral venues, the International Cricket Council said on Thursday ending uncertainty over next year's Champions Trophy.

The arrangement will apply to two major ICC events next year - the men's Champions Trophy in Pakistan and the women's ODI World Cup in India.

It will also be in place for the men's T20 World Cup in 2026, which India will co-host alongside Sri Lanka, and the women's T20 World Cup in 2028 in Pakistan, the ICC said.

"The match schedule for the men's Champions Trophy 2025 will be confirmed in the coming days," the ICC said in a statement.

Due to soured relations, India have not visited Pakistan since 2008 and the rivals play each other only at multi-team events.

Pakistan visited India for the 50-overs World Cup last year but the Indian cricket board (BCCI) has decided not to send its team to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy next year, citing government advice.

Pakistan also hosted the Asia Cup last year but winners India played all their matches in Sri Lanka under.

The Pakistan Cricket Board initially rejected the idea of adopting that "hybrid model" for the Champions Trophy before accepting it on condition that they would be allowed similar favours for ICC events in India.

A politically charged-up India v Pakistan contest is the most anticipated match in any ICC tournament, especially after the suspension of bilateral tours between the bitter cricket-mad neighbours.

PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi is also Pakistan's Interior Minister, while Jay Shah, who was the BCCI secretary until he took over as ICC chairman earlier this month, is the son of India's Home Minister Amit Shah.



Title: Santner named New Zealand's white ball captain

The left-arm spinner will take charge of the team for the first time in a T20 series against Sri Lanka starting in late December

Left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner was named as the successor to Kane Williamson as New Zealand captain in one-day internationals and Twenty20 cricket on Wednesday.

The 32-year-old, who has played 243 internationals and captained his country in 28 short format matches on a temporary basis, will take charge of the team for the first time in a T20 series against Sri Lanka starting in late December.

"It's obviously a huge honour and a privilege to be asked," said Santner, who was named Player of the Match as New Zealand thrashed England in the third test on Tuesday.

"When you're a young kid the dream was always to play for New Zealand but to have the opportunity to officially lead my country in two formats is special."

Williamson stepped down from the white ball captaincy after the T20 World Cup in the United States and Caribbean earlier this year, having handed the test captaincy over to Tim Southee in 2022.

Southee in turn passed it on to Tom Latham in October and coach Gary Stead said the appointment of Santner would allow the opening batsman to concentrate on that job.

"Tom's doing a great job as full-time test captain since taking over in October and we're keen to allow him to focus on that job which requires a considerable amount of time and energy," he said.

Santner said it was an exciting time to take over the short format teams with many of the generation that took New Zealand to the finals of the 2015 and 2019 ODI World Cups having retired or approaching retirement.

"There's obviously a little bit of a changing of the guard with some of our experienced players at the back end of their careers," he said.

"I think that's exciting for the remainder of the group and the young players to now take on the challenge and drive this team forward to further success."



Title: 'Not beholden to stats': Cummins defends Australia's batters

He says his batters fell quickly on Wednesday while chasing quick runs to allow a declaration that could set up a small chance of victory

Second Test - Australia v India - Adelaide Oval, Adelaide, Australia - Dec 7, 2024 Australia's Pat Cummins celebrates with Travis Head after taking the wicket of India's Rohit Sharma Dave Hunt/AAP Image via REUTERS

Australia captain Pat Cummins has leapt to the defence of his top order batsmen after they again struggled for runs in the drawn third Test against India in Brisbane.

Australia collapsed to 33 for five in their second innings at the Gabba on Wednesday, with the top four all dismissed for single-digit scores before Cummins declared at 79 for eight.

The new opening combination of Usman Khawaja and Nathan McSweeney has failed to build a partnership of more than 21 runs in the series, while number three Marnus Labuschagne is averaging 16.40 from his five innings, despite a half-century in the second Test in Adelaide.

Cummins said his batters fell quickly on Wednesday while chasing quick runs to allow a declaration that could set up a small chance of victory.

"We are not beholden to stats," Cummins told reporters.

"We know there are certain roles and easier times to bat and harder times to bat, just like bowlers.

"You are looking at the best seven batters as a unit to play the best you can."

The series is tied at 1-1 ahead of the fourth test in Melbourne starting Dec 26.

The top order's struggles have coincided with eye-catching scores by 19-year-old talent Sam Konstas, who scored a century against an Indian selection in the tour match in Canberra.

He also became the youngest player to score a half-century in the Big Bash League this week on debut in Australia's domestic T20 competition, making 56 from 27 balls for Sydney Thunder.

Pundits have called on selectors to blood Konstas in the test squad after he missed out on selection in favour of McSweeney, who has been retooled as an opener after playing largely at number three.

Cummins defended McSweeney's lean output while declining to comment on whether selectors would stick with him for the remaining matches in Melbourne and Sydney.

"I have been impressed with the way he has gone about it," said Cummins of McSweeney, who was caught behind for four on Wednesday after making nine in the first innings.

"Today for someone starting out his career he was selfless to go out and try and play his shots rather than preserve (his wicket) and get a score.

"He probably hasn't got the runs he would have liked but he has played important knocks that have set up a win in Adelaide and a good result here."



Title: Sammy appointed West Indies coach across all formats

The former captain has demonstrated exceptional leadership during his tenure with the white-ball teams

West Indies have appointed former captain Daren Sammy as coach across all three formats of the game, handing him control of the test team from next year in addition to the one-day international and Twenty20 sides.

The current Test coach, Andre Coley, will remain in charge for January's series against Pakistan before moving into a high-performance role, Cricket West Indies (CWI) said in a statement.

"Daren Sammy has demonstrated exceptional leadership during his tenure with the white-ball teams," said CWI President Kishore Shallow.

"His vision, dedication, and ability to inspire players make him the ideal candidate to lead across all formats. This appointment marks a bold and exciting step forward as we strive to elevate West Indies cricket to new heights."

Sammy, the first St Lucian to play international cricket, captained West Indies to T20 World Cup triumphs in 2012 and 2016 and took charge of the white-ball teams as coach in May 2023.

He will celebrate his 41st birthday on Friday.

West Indies are currently ranked fourth in the T20 world rankings, eighth in tests and 10th in one-day internationals.

The test team have endured a significant decline in fortunes since they were the most feared side in world cricket for a period from the late 1970s to the early 1990s.

The Caribbean islanders have won three of 15 tests since Coley took charge on an interim basis in December 2022, although that did include a notable victory over Australia in Brisbane earlier this year.

"We recognise and appreciate Andre's efforts during his tenure, and look forward to him serving West Indies cricket in other meaningful capacities," said the CWI's director of cricket Miles Bascombe.

"We are confident that there will be a seamless transition from Andre to Daren for the test (team), both are professionals who have worked productively in the past."



Title: Rohit says India won't rush Shami's return unless '200% sure'

Shami has not played international cricket since the 50-overs World Cup last year because of an ankle injury that needed surgery

India will not rush Mohammed Shami return to international cricket in the last two Tests in Australia unless they are "200% sure" about the seamer's fitness, captain Rohit Sharma said on Wednesday.

Shami has not played international cricket since the 50-overs World Cup last year because of an ankle injury that needed surgery.

The 34-year-old, an automatic choice as India's second seamer when fit, has returned to domestic cricket to prove his fitness.

The lack of support for pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah in Australia has prompted demands for Shami's recall but Rohit was cautious about rushing back the bowler, who reported a knee swelling on his comeback trail.

"I understand he's playing a lot of cricket back home, but there have been some complaints about his knee as well," Rohit said after India snatched a draw in the rain-blighted third test in Brisbane on Wednesday.

"The last thing you want is the player coming here and then pulling out in the middle of the game. You know what happens when that kind of thing happens."

He said he would go by the advice of the medics at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) where Shami did his rehabilitation.

"Unless we are not 100% but 200% sure, we're not going to take any risk... the door is open if those guys at the NCA feel that he is okay to go and recover and play. We'll be happy to have him."

Bumrah is currently the leading wicket-taker in the five-Test series in Australia but Mohammed Siraj has not been equally impressive as his new ball colleague.

India will take heart from third seamer Akash Deep's bowling at the Gabba where the right-arm quick claimed three wickets to go with a defiant 31 that helped India avoid follow-on.



Title: India's 'carrom ball' champion Ashwin bows out of international cricket

His 537 wickets from 106 Tests is the second highest by an Indian bowler behind Anil Kumble's 619

Batters around the world heaved a sigh of relief on Wednesday as Ravichandran Ashwin brought down the curtain on an international career that saw the India spinner take more than 500 Test wickets with an arsenal that included the dreaded 'carrom ball'.

The 38-year-old was not selected for the opening Test against Australia in Perth but returned to the side for the day-night second match in Adelaide, where he took one wicket.

That would prove to be his final test after Ashwin was again left out in Brisbane where India snatched a draw in a rain-blighted contest.

Ashwin's 537 wickets from 106 Tests is the second highest by an Indian bowler behind Anil Kumble's 619. He also played 116 one-dayers and 65 Twenty20 Internationals, finishing with 765 wickets across formats.

"This will be my last day as an Indian cricketer in all formats at the international level," a composed Ashwin told reporters with captain Rohit Sharma by his side.

"I do feel there's a bit of punch left in me as a cricketer, but I would like to express that and probably showcase that in club-level cricket."

Since making his India debut in an ODI against Sri Lanka in 2010, Ashwin went on to fill the void created by the retirement of Kumble.

A cerebral spinner with a fast bowler's aggression, Ashwin grew to become a match-winner on India's turning tracks, where his impeccable control and ability to bowl long spells made him a huge asset.

Obsessed with the small details of his craft, the off-spinner constantly tinkered with his technique in his relentless quest for perfection.

Ashwin bowled leg spin in domestic cricket to expand his repertoire and mastered the 'carrom ball', in which he flicked the ball with knuckle.

He is also an unabashed advocate of 'Mankading', famously running out Jos Buttler after the Englishman had strayed out of the crease at the non-striker's end during an Indian Premier League match.

The Indian was a big influence on his peers, with Australian spinner Nathan Lyon calling him one of his "biggest coaches' in the run-up to the ongoing series for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

Ashwin, who will return home on Thursday, also evolved into a decent Test all-rounder, hitting six hundreds in the format.

India captain Rohit said he convinced Ashwin to stay on for the pink ball Test in Adelaide after learning of the spinner's retirement plans.

While Ashwin's retirement was kept tightly under wraps, the emotional-looking spinner was pictured hugging team mate Virat Kohli in the team changing room during the match on Wednesday.

"I have created a lot of memories alongside Rohit and several of my other teammates, even though I have lost some of them (from the India side) over the last few years," Ashwin said of his contemporaries.

"We're the last bunch of OGs, if we can say that, left out in the dressing room, and I will be marking this as my date of having played at this level."



Title: Australia's Head brushes off fitness query after struggling at Gabba

He earned his second successive Player of the Match award at the Gabba after scoring 152

Australia batsman Travis Head brushed off concerns about his fitness after he struggled to run on day five of the drawn third Test against India on Wednesday, insisting that he will be fit for the next clash in Melbourne.

The middle order batter hobbled when running between wickets and did not take the field during India's brief fourth innings at the Gabba, prompting speculation of a possible quadriceps injury.

"It's just a bit sore. I will be fine," he said when asked about his prospects of playing in the traditional "Boxing Day Test" at the Melbourne Cricket Ground from Dec 26.

Losing Head, the team's most in-form batsman, would be a massive blow for Australia's hopes of winning the five-test series which is level at 1-1.

He earned his second successive Player of the Match award at the Gabba after scoring 152 in Australia's first innings 445, having scored a match-winning hundred in the second Test in Adelaide.

Head also took a wicket at the Gabba with his part-time spin to wrap up India's first innings for 260 in the morning on day five, having tailender Akash Deep stumped for 31.



Title: Bangladesh bowlers topple West Indies to clinch T20 series

Though Bangladesh posted only 129 with the bat, disciplined bowling led the Tigers to a win

A disciplined bowling attack has seen Bangladesh beat the West Indies by 27 runs in the second T20 in Kingstown to win the series.

The hosts won the toss and sent Bangladesh into bat. The runs seemed to come reluctantly as players struggled to find the boundary.

The difference maker was Shamim Hossain, who posted a blazing 35 runs off 17 deliveries with two fours and two sixes at the tail end of the innings. Mehidy Hasan Miraz contributed 26 off 25 balls, while Jaker Ali hit 21 off 20.

But it was Bangladesh’s bowlers who would prove to be the difference. Taskin Ahmed led the line, picking up 3-16, while Rishad Hossain nabbed 2-12, Mahedi Hasan 2-20, and Tanzim Hasan Sakib 2-22.

The West Indies struggled to put up any resistance, with only three batsmen making it to double figures.

However, the Tigers had to weather a scare even after the hosts looked winded at 42-6. Roston Chase (32) and Akeal Hosein (31) played a few cautious overs, getting comfortable at the crease before suddenly exploding with a number of sixes in the final few overs.

Rishad eventually broke through the partnership by bowling out Chase as he attempted to clear the ground once again. He struck once more with the very next delivery to dismiss Gudakesh Motie.

Taskin polished off the innings by taking out Hosein with a clever change of pace in the 19th over.



Title: Bangladesh crush West Indies by 80 runs to complete T20 series sweep

After setting a daunting target of 190, the visitors bundle out the Caribbean side for 109 runs to win the third T20

Bangladesh have romped to a resounding 80-run win in the third and final T20 match against the West Indies to sweep the series 3-0. This is Bangladesh's biggest win in T20Is against the Caribbean side.

The Tigers had only achieved whitewashes in T20 series twice before: against England at home last year and against Ireland away in 2012.

However, this victory carries extra significance. Coming on the heels of a disappointing ODI series whitewash, and achieved without key players like regular captain Najmul Hossain Shanto, Towhid Hridoy, and Mustafizur Rahman, the triumph marks a memorable end to a challenging year for Bangladesh cricket.

The match in St Vincent on Friday morning Bangladesh time saw Parvez Hossain Emon returning to the side and giving the team a solid start with the bat. Jaker Ali then stole the show with a blistering knock, helping the visitors post a commanding total of 189 runs in their 20 overs.

In reply, the West Indies collapsed for just 109 runs to hand a remarkable victory to Bangladesh.

Jaker lit up the match with a breathtaking 72* off just 41 balls, smashing six sixes and displaying incredible skill, power, and match awareness. Earlier in the tour, he impressed with two brilliant Test innings and solid ODI performances. He capped off the T20 series by dismantling the West Indies bowlers with ease.

Once Jaker set the tone, the Bangladeshi bowlers completed the job with minimal fuss. Rishad Hossain, who has had an outstanding year, posted his career-best figures of 3 wickets for 21 runs. Taskin Ahmed, Mahedi Hasan, and Hasan Mahmud also bowled with precision and rhythm to put the squeeze on one of the most dangerous teams in cricket's shortest format.

DOMINANT START

After winning toss and electing to bat, Bangladesh dominated from the get-go in Kingstown. Parvez, stepping in for the injured Soumya Sarkar, began with a classy boundary and soon showcased his power hitting. Alongside skipper Litton Das, he put up a brisk opening stand of 40 runs in the first four overs.

However, Litton’s promising start, highlighted by three elegant boundaries, ended in disappointment as he was dismissed for a run-a-ball 13. Parvez followed soon after, falling for a quickfire 39 off 20 balls, including four boundaries and two sixes.

The momentum slowed after Tanzid Hasan’s brief cameo, where he struck a six before being dismissed. The Tigers managed only 36 runs between the fifth and 10th overs. Mehidy Hasan Miraz attempted to hit the accelerator, scoring a handy 29 off 22 balls, but his innings ended prematurely.

Then came Jaker's moment. Starting cautiously with just 10 runs off 13 balls, he switched gears in the 14th over with a slog-swept six off Gudakesh Motie. Surviving a near run-out, Jaker took complete control, dominating the West Indies bowlers. His range of shots cleared every part of the ground—long-on, mid-wicket, and extra cover.

Despite quick dismissals of Shamim Hossain (2) and Mahedi (0), Jaker continued the onslaught. In the last five overs, he smashed five sixes and two boundaries, including a colossal 95-metre six off Obed McCoy. He brought up his fifty in style with a boundary off Alzarri Joseph and finished the innings by hammering three sixes in a 25-run final over as Bangladesh ended with a commanding total of 189 for 6.

CLINICAL BOWLING DISPLAY

Defending the target, Bangladesh struck early. Taskin bowled an outswinger followed by an inswinger to trap Brandon King leg-before for a duck in the first over.

Mahedi then dismissed debutant Justin Greaves in the second over. While Johnson Charles and Nicholas Pooran counterattacked briefly, adding 34 runs in three overs, Bangladesh hit back quickly. Mahedi dismissed Pooran (15 off 10) for the third time in the series, and Hasan Mahmud kept Roston Chase scoreless. Rishad’s brilliant direct hit ran out Charles (18 off 23), and soon after, he dismissed Rovman Powell with the ball.

The West Indies collapsed, losing four wickets for just 14 runs, leaving them teetering at 60/6. Romario Shepherd tried to rescue his side with a spirited 33 off 27 balls, but his efforts only helped the hosts cross 100 as Bangladesh cruised to a comprehensive victory.

Brief Score:

Bangladesh: 189/7 in 20 overs (Litton 14, Parvez 39, Tanzid 9, Miraz 29, Jaker 72* (41 balls, 6 sixes), Shamim 2, Mahedi 0, Tanzim 17, Rishad 0*; Shepherd 4-0-30-2, Joseph 4-0-59-1, Chase 4-0-15-1, Motie 3-0-30-1)

Title: Afghanistan enjoy record ODI win helped by Atal ton against Zimbabwe

They have scored 286-6, led by Atal's 104 and Malik's 84

Afghanistan recorded their biggest One-Day International victory with a 232-run win against hosts Zimbabwe after opener Sediqullah Atal's maiden ODI century and figures of 3-9 by off-spinner AM Ghazanfar at the Harare Sports Club on Thursday.

After being sent in to bat, Afghanistan amassed 286 for six in their 50 overs, led by Atal’s 104 from 128 balls as part of an opening stand of 191 with Abdul Malik (84 from 101 balls).

Zimbabwe struggled from the start of their reply and were bowled out for 54, the joint lowest Afghanistan have dismissed a side for in ODI cricket. It matches the score they skittled Zimbabwe for at the same venue in 2017.

Afghanistan have a 1-0 lead after two matches in the three-game series with the first fixture rained out. The third and final game is at the Harare Sports Club on Saturday.



Title: India-Pakistan matches at ICC events to be held at neutral venues

Due to soured relations, India have not visited Pakistan since 2008 and the rivals play each other only at multi-team events

Matches between politically-estranged rivals India and Pakistan at ICC events that either nation is due to host will be played at neutral venues, the International Cricket Council said on Thursday ending uncertainty over next year's Champions Trophy.

The arrangement will apply to two major ICC events next year - the men's Champions Trophy in Pakistan and the women's ODI World Cup in India.

It will also be in place for the men's T20 World Cup in 2026, which India will co-host alongside Sri Lanka, and the women's T20 World Cup in 2028 in Pakistan, the ICC said.

"The match schedule for the men's Champions Trophy 2025 will be confirmed in the coming days," the ICC said in a statement.

Due to soured relations, India have not visited Pakistan since 2008 and the rivals play each other only at multi-team events.

Pakistan visited India for the 50-overs World Cup last year but the Indian cricket board (BCCI) has decided not to send its team to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy next year, citing government advice.

Pakistan also hosted the Asia Cup last year but winners India played all their matches in Sri Lanka under.

The Pakistan Cricket Board initially rejected the idea of adopting that "hybrid model" for the Champions Trophy before accepting it on condition that they would be allowed similar favours for ICC events in India.

A politically charged-up India v Pakistan contest is the most anticipated match in any ICC tournament, especially after the suspension of bilateral tours between the bitter cricket-mad neighbours.

PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi is also Pakistan's Interior Minister, while Jay Shah, who was the BCCI secretary until he took over as ICC chairman earlier this month, is the son of India's Home Minister Amit Shah.



Title: India hope misfiring top order will come good after Gabba jailbreak

They snatched a draw in the rain-blighted third Test in Brisbane

A jailbreak at the Gabba has brought a palpable sense of relief in the India camp, while giving rise to hope their misfiring top order will finally come good in more batting-friendly conditions in the final two Tests against Australia.

India snatched a draw in the rain-blighted third Test in Brisbane despite yet another top order debacle that left them reeling at 74-5 in reply to Australia's 445.

Number seven batter Ravindra Jadeja inspired a spirited rearguard action and India's final pair of Akash Deep and Jasprit Bumrah combined in a 47-run partnership to stave off follow-on.

While India managed to keep the five-Test series level at 1-1 heading into the Boxing day test in Melbourne, the fragility of their top order remains a major concern for the tourists.

In five completed innings so far in the series, only once have India managed an opening stand of more than 12 runs.

The lone exception came in the second innings of the series opener in Perth where Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul forged a 201-run partnership to set up their comprehensive victory.

The poor starts meant on three out of those five occasions, India posted sub-200 scores, including twice in the day-night second Test in Adelaide, which Australia won by 10 wickets.

There is a growing feeling in the camp, though, that the worst is behind them and that batting will be easier in the last two tests in Melbourne and Sydney.

"Whatever happened today, it gave us confidence ahead of Melbourne," India captain Rohit Sharma told reporters on Wednesday.

"We're aware we have to start from scratch, conditions are different there and the ball may not move around so much there like it did here."

Rohit's own struggle with form is symptomatic of the greater malaise afflicting the Indian top order.

The 37-year-old, who missed the opening Test to be with his newborn son in Mumbai, has just one fifty in his last 13 test innings.

The opener has moved down to the middle order in his bid to regain form but managed a highest score of 10 in three innings.

"I have not batted well, there is no harm in accepting that," Rohit said, denying he was feeling under pressure.

"As long as my mind, my body and my feet are moving well, I'm pretty happy with how things are panning out for me."

India need to win both matches to make the World Test Championship (WTC) final for the third time in a row without having to rely on other results.

Champions Australia need two wins and a draw in their next four tests, which include two in Sri Lanka, to be sure of qualification.



Title: Maharaj out of Pakistan ODIs, doubt for crucial Test series

South Africa are top of the World Test Championship table and need victory in one of their two remaining matches against Pakistan

First choice spinner Keshav Maharaj has been ruled out of the remaining two One-Day Internationals against Pakistan and is a doubt for the crucial two-Test home series against the sub-continent side that starts on Dec 26.

Maharaj has a left adductor strain and will miss the 50-over fixtures in Cape Town on Thursday and Johannesburg on Sunday, but of much greater concern will be the 34-year-old’s availability for the Test series.

South Africa are top of the World Test Championship table and need victory in one of their two remaining matches against Pakistan to guarantee a place at the Lord’s final in June next year.

Should Maharaj be unavailable, the only specialist spinner in the Test squad is the less experienced Senuran Muthusamy. Bjorn Fortuin has been named as his replacement for the final two ODIs.



Title: Dias injury latest blow in Manchester City's calamitous run

Defender Akanji has returned to training after injury, boosting Guardiola's squad

Manchester City will be without defender Ruben Dias for three to four weeks with a muscle injury, manager Pep Guardiola said on Friday, another blow for the reeling champions whose hopes of hanging on to the Premier League title are dwindling.

City travel to Aston Villa on Saturday hoping to right the ship amid the worst run of results in Guardiola's managerial career that has them languishing fifth in the league table. They also have just one victory to show for their last 11 games across all competitions.

Dias was injured in City's calamitous 2-1 derby loss to Manchester United on Sunday.

"It was a muscular injury, (after) 75 minutes against Manchester United he felt something. He is so strong and he stayed on the pitch and now he is injured," Guardiola told reporters on Friday.

Fellow defender Manuel Akanji, however, returned to training this week after suffering an injury early this month, "which is good for us," Guardiola said.

City lost to United in spectacular fashion last weekend, leading in the 88th minute before their cross-town rivals scored two goals in less than two minutes.

Guardiola looked disconsolate after, and pointed the finger squarely at himself for the shocking run, telling reporters during a long and heartfelt post-game press conference that "I am not good enough."

His mood had improved by Friday.

"I just finished a game where we were close to winning and we lost. For the sequences that happened I was not happy," Guardiola said. "I tried to be honest with myself here right now in six or seven days ago, (but) if you fall down six times you have to stand up seven.

"I am fine. I am a normal person with feelings like all of us. When a situation is going well we are better and when it is not going well professionally we are more (focused) on what we have to do."

Just two points and two places behind Guardiola's team in the league table, Aston Villa will climb over City with a victory on Saturday at Villa Park.

Unai Emery's team have also had significantly more success than City in their Champions League campaign, where they are fifth in the standings with two games left in the league phase while City are languishing in 22nd.

"I'm not surprised. Top, excellent manager. (They had good success) qualifying for the Champions League and the results in the Champions League they speak for themselves," Guardiola said. "They are handling it well because when I have been in many clubs handling both competitions, they have done really well."

City lost 1-0 at Villa Park just over a year ago before rebounding to thrash Emery's side 4-1 in early-April. Guardiola said, however, there was little he could glean from those games.

"Why do you have to compare what happened?" the Spaniard said. "The past is the past, this is a new moment, you have to deal with it."



Title: Pakistan outplay South Africa to earn 81-run ODI win at Newlands

Shaheen Shah Afridi produced a spell of high-quality seam bowling as Pakistan claimed their One-Day International series against South Africa with a game to spare following a comprehensive 81-run victory at Newlands on Thursday.

Pakistan have an unassailable 2-0 lead ahead of the third and final fixture in Johannesburg on Sunday.

South Africa surprisingly sent the visitors into bat on a ground where it is known to be difficult to chase under lights, and Pakistan posted an above-par 329 all out.

Heinrich Klaasen provided the only real resistance for South Africa with an excellent 97 from 74 balls but was the last man out as they were dismissed for 248 in 43.1 overs, having been outplayed in all facets of the game.

Captain Mohammad Rizwan scored 80 from 82 balls to anchor the Pakistan innings, but the impetus for their total came from a superb 63 from 32 deliveries by Kamran Ghulam.

Babar Azam provided 73 in 95 deliveries with the visitors profiting from some sloppy South African fielding as they dropped numerous catches and were not accurate enough with the ball.

Debutant fast bowler Kwena Maphaka, 18, returned figures of 4-72 in his 10 overs, the pick of a disappointing bowling effort from South Africa.

Several of the home side’s batters got starts but Pakistan picked up wickets at regular intervals and Klaasen ran out of partners in the chase.

Afridi showed superb control and recorded figures of 4-47 as he ripped through the South African middle order, removing the dangerous David Miller for 29 to take the game away from the home side.



Title: Barcelona unhappy with recent run but will fight to the end, says Flick

They lead LaLiga with 38 points, ahead of Atletico and Real

Barcelona will battle until the end to win titles, according to head coach Hansi Flick, who said he was unhappy with their current situation as they look to avoid a third consecutive home defeat in LaLiga when they host Atletico Madrid on Saturday.

After a superb start to the season which saw them win 14 of their first 16 matches across all competitions, Barcelona lost their way domestically with Sunday's 1-0 home defeat to 15th-placed Leganes leaving them with one victory in their last six league games.

But they remain top of the LaLiga table with 38 points, level with second-placed Atletico and one point ahead of Real Madrid in third, with both their title rivals having a game in hand.

To make matters worse for the Catalan side, Atletico have been in terrific form ahead of the highly-anticipated clash at the Lluis Companys Olympic Stadium, having won their last 11 matches in all competitions.

"What I can feel in the city and the supporters know what the team is like. We lost five important players. (Attacking midfielder) Dani Olmo and (forward) Pau Victor are the (new) signings. The team has improved and is focused," Flick told reporters on Friday.

"We are not happy with the situation, but we are going to fight until the end of the season. We want to win titles, but we know it won't be easy. But we want to win, that's what we want to do tomorrow."

The German said there will be little room for error if they are to win against Atletico, but they were ready for the occasion.

"It's the end of the year. It's a great game. It's one of the best rivals. But today is Dec. 20 and we're first in LaLiga and second in the Champions League. We are not bad. We lost some points against Las Palmas (2-1 loss) and Leganes, we have to recover them," Flick added.

"Tomorrow is another game. We have a young team and we have to fight and improve. We want to achieve great things. But we know it won't be easy. We have to start fighting tomorrow. We are playing against great teams."

Barcelona have suffered a blow with winger Lamine Yamal suffering an ankle injury during their loss against Leganes. The 17-year-old Spain international is expected to be out for three to four weeks.

"We have to accept that he is injured and won't be able to play," Flick said.



Title: U-19 Women's Asia Cup: Bangladesh breeze past Nepal to set up final clash with India

The Tigresses beat Nepal by 9 wickets in Kuala Lumpur

Bangladesh have trounced Nepal by 9 wickets to secure a berth in the final of the Under-19 Women’s Asia Cup.

On Friday, the young Tigresses bounced back in style from their earlier loss to India in the Super Four stage opener in Kuala Lumpur.

In a rain-curtailed 11-over game, Nepal managed just 54 runs, which Bangladesh chased down comfortably in 9.5 overs.

Bangladesh will face India in the final on Sunday at the same venue.

After winning the toss, Bangladesh opted to field and immediately put pressure on Nepal. A combination of tight bowling and poor running between the wickets left Nepal struggling. Three of their first four wickets were run-outs within the first six overs.

Nepal's highest partnership was a 19-run stand between captain Puja Mahato and Sabitri Dhami for the second wicket. Dhami, the only batter to reach double figures, scored 11 off 12 balls.

Farjana Easmin, Anisa Akter, Fahomida Choya, and Habiba Islam chipped in with a wicket apiece for Bangladesh.

Chasing a modest target, openers Fahomida and Mosammat Eva got the Tigresses off to a flying start. Fahmida struck boundaries in consecutive overs, while Eva hit the only six of the match in the fifth over.

The opening partnership of 46 runs ended in the eighth over when Eva was bowled by Kusum Godar for 18 off 21 balls. However, Fahomida guided her team across the finish line with an unbeaten 26 off 32 balls, alongside Sumaiya Akhter, who added 10 runs off six balls.

Fahomida was named Player of the Match for her all-round performance.

Match Summary:

Nepal U-19: 54/8 in 11 overs (Dhami 11, Mahato 9; Farzana 1/13, Anisa 1/10, Fahomida 1/14, Habiba 1/11)

Bangladesh U-19: 58/1 in 9.5 overs (Fahomida 26*, Eva 18, Sumaiya 10*)

Result: Bangladesh won by 9 wickets.

Player of the Match: Fahomida Choya



Title: Bangladesh crush West Indies by 80 runs to complete T20 series sweep

After setting a daunting target of 190, the visitors bundle out the Caribbean side for 109 runs to win the third T20

Bangladesh have romped to a resounding 80-run win in the third and final T20 match against the West Indies to sweep the series 3-0. This is Bangladesh's biggest win in T20Is against the Caribbean side.

The Tigers had only achieved whitewashes in T20 series twice before: against England at home last year and against Ireland away in 2012.

However, this victory carries extra significance. Coming on the heels of a disappointing ODI series whitewash, and achieved without key players like regular captain Najmul Hossain Shanto, Towhid Hridoy, and Mustafizur Rahman, the triumph marks a memorable end to a challenging year for Bangladesh cricket.

The match in St Vincent on Friday morning Bangladesh time saw Parvez Hossain Emon returning to the side and giving the team a solid start with the bat. Jaker Ali then stole the show with a blistering knock, helping the visitors post a commanding total of 189 runs in their 20 overs.

In reply, the West Indies collapsed for just 109 runs to hand a remarkable victory to Bangladesh.

Jaker lit up the match with a breathtaking 72* off just 41 balls, smashing six sixes and displaying incredible skill, power, and match awareness. Earlier in the tour, he impressed with two brilliant Test innings and solid ODI performances. He capped off the T20 series by dismantling the West Indies bowlers with ease.

Once Jaker set the tone, the Bangladeshi bowlers completed the job with minimal fuss. Rishad Hossain, who has had an outstanding year, posted his career-best figures of 3 wickets for 21 runs. Taskin Ahmed, Mahedi Hasan, and Hasan Mahmud also bowled with precision and rhythm to put the squeeze on one of the most dangerous teams in cricket's shortest format.

DOMINANT START

After winning toss and electing to bat, Bangladesh dominated from the get-go in Kingstown. Parvez, stepping in for the injured Soumya Sarkar, began with a classy boundary and soon showcased his power hitting. Alongside skipper Litton Das, he put up a brisk opening stand of 40 runs in the first four overs.

However, Litton’s promising start, highlighted by three elegant boundaries, ended in disappointment as he was dismissed for a run-a-ball 13. Parvez followed soon after, falling for a quickfire 39 off 20 balls, including four boundaries and two sixes.

The momentum slowed after Tanzid Hasan’s brief cameo, where he struck a six before being dismissed. The Tigers managed only 36 runs between the fifth and 10th overs. Mehidy Hasan Miraz attempted to hit the accelerator, scoring a handy 29 off 22 balls, but his innings ended prematurely.

Then came Jaker's moment. Starting cautiously with just 10 runs off 13 balls, he switched gears in the 14th over with a slog-swept six off Gudakesh Motie. Surviving a near run-out, Jaker took complete control, dominating the West Indies bowlers. His range of shots cleared every part of the ground—long-on, mid-wicket, and extra cover.

Despite quick dismissals of Shamim Hossain (2) and Mahedi (0), Jaker continued the onslaught. In the last five overs, he smashed five sixes and two boundaries, including a colossal 95-metre six off Obed McCoy. He brought up his fifty in style with a boundary off Alzarri Joseph and finished the innings by hammering three sixes in a 25-run final over as Bangladesh ended with a commanding total of 189 for 6.

CLINICAL BOWLING DISPLAY

Defending the target, Bangladesh struck early. Taskin bowled an outswinger followed by an inswinger to trap Brandon King leg-before for a duck in the first over.

Mahedi then dismissed debutant Justin Greaves in the second over. While Johnson Charles and Nicholas Pooran counterattacked briefly, adding 34 runs in three overs, Bangladesh hit back quickly. Mahedi dismissed Pooran (15 off 10) for the third time in the series, and Hasan Mahmud kept Roston Chase scoreless. Rishad’s brilliant direct hit ran out Charles (18 off 23), and soon after, he dismissed Rovman Powell with the ball.

The West Indies collapsed, losing four wickets for just 14 runs, leaving them teetering at 60/6. Romario Shepherd tried to rescue his side with a spirited 33 off 27 balls, but his efforts only helped the hosts cross 100 as Bangladesh cruised to a comprehensive victory.

Brief Score:

Bangladesh: 189/7 in 20 overs (Litton 14, Parvez 39, Tanzid 9, Miraz 29, Jaker 72* (41 balls, 6 sixes), Shamim 2, Mahedi 0, Tanzim 17, Rishad 0*; Shepherd 4-0-30-2, Joseph 4-0-59-1, Chase 4-0-15-1, Motie 3-0-30-1)

West Indies: 109 in 16.4 overs (King 0, Charles 23, Greaves 6, Pooran 15, Chase 0, Powell 2, Shepherd 33, Akeal 31, Motie 12, Joseph 1, McCoy 5, Seales 4*; Rishad 4-0-21-3, Taskin 3.4-0-30-2, Mahedi 3-0-13-2, Hasan 3-0-9-1, Tanzim 3-0-31-1)

Result: Bangladesh won by 80 runs

Series result: Bangladesh won the 3-match series 3-0

Player of the Match: Jaker Ali

Player of the Series: Mahedi Hasan

Reigning world champions Argentina have kept top spot in the final FIFA men's world ranking of 2024 for a second consecutive year, with no changes in the top 10 of the latest list published on Thursday.

Lionel Scaloni's Argentina, who were crowned Copa America champions for a record 16th time after they beat Colombia in July, continue to lead the way ahead of second-placed France and Euro 2024 winners Spain in third.

Euro runners-up England, Brazil, Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and Germany were next in the top 10.

Angola were the biggest mover of the year, climbing 32 places to finish 85th.
