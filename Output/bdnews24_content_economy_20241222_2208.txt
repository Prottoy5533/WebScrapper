Title: Bangladeshi expats send over $2 billion remittance in three weeks of December

It marks five consecutive months with over $2 billion in remittances

In the first 21 days of December 2024, expatriates have sent nearly $2.07 billion in remittances to their families and beneficiaries.

In contrast, $1.72 billion was received in the first 23 days of November.

Throughout the entire month of November, $2.19 billion in remittances came through banking channels.

On Sunday, Bangladesh Bank released an updated report revealing that remittances exceeded $2 billion in three weeks, marking five consecutive months with over $2 billion in remittances.

Since April this year, expatriates have been sending more than $2 billion each month, with the exception of July when the figure dipped below this threshold.

Commenting on the upward trend, Syed Mahbubur Rahman, managing director of Mutual Trust Bank, told bdnews24.com: "The remittance rate through banking channels has increased from before, which is why more remittances are coming."

In addition to a 2.5 percent incentive, expatriates are receiving over Tk120 per dollar when sending money through banks. Bankers believe this has significantly boosted remittances through banking channels.

In May of this year, the central bank introduced the "crawling peg" system to determine the dollar exchange rate, causing the dollar rate to jump from Tk 110 to 117. Later, the remittance rate through banking channels was set at Tk 120 per dollar.

Thanks to the positive trend in remittances, $11.11 billion was received during the five months from July to November of the current 2024–25 fiscal year.

This marks a 26.40 percent increase compared with $8.79 billion during the same period in the previous fiscal year.



Title: WB, ADB to give $1.1bn in support for Yunus govt

The interim government hopes the funds will be made available to them in December

The Ministry of Finance says that the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have approved $1.1 billion in budget support for the interim government led by Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus.

The government hopes the funds will be made available this December.

The WB has approved two budget support funds amounting to $500 million and the ADB has approved $600 million in support to accelerate the interim government’s reform and development activities.

In addition to the budget support, the WB has also approved $379 million for the health and nutrition sector and $280 million in project support for developing the water supply system in Chattogram.

On Dec 18, a loan agreement of $600 million was signed between the Bangladesh government and the ADP for the programme titled “Strengthening Economic Management and Governance Program”. The programme was formulated under an initiative by the Finance Division.

On Dec 19, the WB approved $500 million in budget support for Bangladesh. It is providing the funds under the “Second Bangladesh Green and Climate Resilient Development Credit”, which aims to support reforms to help the country's transition to green and climate-resilient development.



Title: Inflation figures are not manipulated, reflect reality: Finance Advisor Salehuddin

The finance advisor dismisses claims of manipulation, clarifies the causes behind rising inflation rates

Finance Advisor Salehuddin Ahmed has clarified that the rising inflation rate is a true reflection of the economy, rejecting claims of manipulation.

He explained that the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, or BBS, was instructed to release the data that was available, with no attempt to hide information.

Speaking at the launch of the sixth edition of the Banking Almanac at Dhaka's CIRDAP auditorium on Saturday, Salehuddin acknowledged past discrepancies in data related to inflation and gross domestic product, or GDP, attributing them to both unintentional mistakes and attempts by policymakers to conceal information.

Despite multiple interest rate hikes, inflation has continued to rise in Bangladesh, hitting 11.38 percent in November, up from 10.87 percent in the previous month.

This means that a basket of goods and services that cost Tk 100 in November 2023 would cost Tk 111.38 in November 2024.

The finance advisor said that the interim government is not here to show off its capacity, but to address discrepancies in the last 15 years of data.

He said efforts are underway to correct and revise this information, which was previously concealed.

He also said donor organisations have raised questions about the issue, but the interim government have clarifying that the earlier data was hidden and that they are now presenting the correct figures.

The advisor also highlighted issues in the capital markets, criticising investors for buying worthless "Z-category" shares with no real value, warning that these will soon become worthless.

He urged investors to be cautious and criticised market players and regulators for their roles in the ongoing issues.



Title: Reserves reach $20 billion as Bangladesh Bank buys dollars to meet IMF conditions

Bangladesh Bank aims for $15.30 billion in net reserves by December end

Foreign exchange reserves have risen sharply within a week as the central bank purchased dollars from commercial banks to meet the International Monetary Fund, or IMF, conditions.

Bangladesh Bank said foreign exchange reserves stood at $19.95 billion under the BPM-6 method, up from $19.20 billion on Dec 11—an increase of $753 million in a week.

A senior central bank official told bdnews24.com: “Bangladesh Bank wants to increase its net reserves to $15.30 billion by the end of December in compliance with the IMF conditions.

“That is why it is buying from commercial banks instead of selling dollars.”

When asked if the reserves were rising due to dollar purchases, Bangladesh Bank Executive Director and Spokesperson Husne Ara Shikha told bdnews24.com: “I will not explain how the reserves are increasing.”

The central bank's dollar purchases have caused the value of the US currency to rise against the taka.

On Wednesday, some private banks bought remittances at Tk 126.50 to Tk 127, up from Tk 120 a month earlier, while money exchanges sold dollars at even higher rates.

Another official said: “Many banks are selling dollars to the central bank instead of the interbank market, and foreign exchange houses are also selling dollars to banks at higher rates.”

Last month, the reserves fell to $18 billion due to the payment of import liabilities through the Asian Clearing Union, or ACU.

As remittances and export earnings flowed in, reserves rose, though they remained below levels seen when the Sheikh Hasina government fell in August.

Bangladesh Bank reported $20.48 billion in reserves on Jul 30, a figure that remained unchanged on Aug 21.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, reserves peaked at a record $48 billion.

However, rising global fuel and food prices, coupled with the Ukraine war, drove up import costs, leading to a steady decline in reserves since 2022.

In the past two fiscal years, Bangladesh Bank sold dollars from reserves to facilitate government Letters of Credit, or LCs, for commercial banks, further depleting foreign exchange reserves.

Following Hasina’s departure, Ahsan H Mansur assumed the role of Bangladesh Bank governor.

At a press conference, he announced a halt to dollar sales from reserves, saying this would boost reserves and eliminate the risk of further decline.

However, reserves have yet to cross the $20 billion mark even after four months, despite repeated assurances from Bangladesh Bank about their growth.



Title: Fourth tranche of IMF loan may arrive in February

The overall picture of Bangladesh's economy is still not very promising, the IMF delegation says

The International Monetary Fund, or IMF, will release the fourth tranche of its ongoing loan programme, amounting to $645 million, following the approval the executive board at a meeting in February.

Chris Papageorgiou, chief of the Development Macroeconomics Division in the Research Department of the IMF, made the announcement at a press conference at the finance ministry on Thursday.

Before the release of the fourth instalment, a 13-strong delegation came to review the progress of the reform proposals made by the IMF on Bangladesh’s economy.

Before returning, they held a press conference at the ministry.

Regarding the release of the money, the head of the IMF delegation said the proposal for the release of the tranche will be raised at the IMF Executive Board meeting on Feb 5. It will be distributed once it is approved.

Papageorgiou said, “The overall picture of Bangladesh's economy is still not very promising. Inflation remains out of control for a long time. The current inflation rate of 9.6 percent is much higher than the IMF's estimate. Bangladesh Bank will have to play a more active role in controlling the crisis.”

He said the IMF is positive about providing assistance to Bangladesh. However, the growth of domestic income and the reform of the banking sector must continue.

Regarding the printing of new currency notes, he said: “The printing of new money is also a matter of concern. It may bring a temporary relief, but not for a long time.”



Title: Bangladesh Bank looks at 'new mechanism' as dollar rates crawl up

"We didn't expect dollar prices to increase this much. It rose to Tk 127-128. Besides, Bangladesh Bank isn't selling dollars," says the managing director of Citizens Bank

As the demand in the import sector jumps ahead of Ramadan and the central bank preparing to boost its reserves, the price of the dollar has gone up.

Although Bangladesh Bank fixed the exchange rate at Tk 120, some private banks bought remittances at Tk 126.50 to Tk 127 on Tuesday. The money changing houses also sold dollars at a raised rate.

In consideration of the overall situation, Bangladesh Bank is pondering launching a 'new mechanism,' said its spokesperson Executive Director Husne Ara Shikha. A circular will be issued in this regard on Thursday, she said.

Demand for imports have surged as Ramadan looms in March. On the other hand, Bangladesh Bank aims to push net reserves up to $15.30 billion at the end of December to meet the condition imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). As such, instead of selling, the central bank is purchasing dollars from the commercial banks. Under the circumstances, inflation, which was already increased in November, may increase further due to a hike in import prices.

"Dollar prices went up mainly because of the increased demand in the import business," said BB spokesperson Shikha.

There are a few reasons behind the exchange rate hike, a senior official at the central bank told bdnews24.com. "Mainly, the banks are increasing imports with the coming of Ramadan. This has pushed up the demand for dollars. However, the remittance and export flow is not enough to match the import demand," he explained.

Moreover, the central bank is purchasing dollars from commercial banks to increase its foreign currency reserves. Hence, many banks are selling dollars to Bangladesh Bank, instead of selling at the interbank level. "The foreign exchange houses are also selling dollars at an increased rate."

Banks purchase dollars from two sources - remitters and exporters, said the treasury head of a private bank.

The dollars bought from the exporters usually cost Tk 119 to Tk 120, while remittances are purchased at a slightly higher price. The authorities open LCs using an average of these two prices.

"Bangladesh Bank usually sells dollars to other banks, which it has halted for now. Instead, it is buying dollars from the banks to increase the reserves. Also, more LCs are opened before Ramadan. Hence, the banks need more dollars," the treasury head added.

"We didn't expect dollar prices to increase this much. It rose to Tk 127-128. Besides, Bangladesh Bank isn't selling dollars," said the managing director of Citizens Bank Mohammad Masum.

Masum said that one of the reasons behind the price hike was the surging demand for opening LCs in the import business. "On the other side, the IMF imposed a condition that the reserves shouldn't drop. Which means that the net reserve level should be maintained."

"If a bank buys remittances at a higher rate, it can't sell dollars at a lower rate. Nobody runs their business for losses. As per the law, you can't face financial loss in a foreign exchange business. This is an offence as per the banking law. Hence, the price is surging as the supply isn't sufficient," said a deputy managing director of a bank on condition of anonymity.

Inflation may rise further in mid-December with the rising exchange rate and hike in import costs. According to the updated information of the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), inflation stood at 11.38 percent in November. The figure was 10.87 percent the month before.

Bangladesh Bank introduced a ‘crawling peg,’ system for the exchange rate in May this year. This resulted in the rate jumping by Tk 7 and reached Tk 117. Then the rate was fixed at Tk 120 using the ‘crawling peg,’ system. Now Bangladesh Bank is looking into new options to address the exchange rate hike.



Title: Trump, not yet in office, already a figure in global economic policy

The US central bankers pencil in estimates for higher growth next year than previously estimated, but also notably higher inflation

The world's economic reckoning with the incoming Trump administration kicked off in earnest this week, with the US Federal Reserve flagging fewer rate cuts, a resignation in Canada over budgeting for tariffs and a heightened focus on cryptocurrencies.

The Fed cut rates as expected on Wednesday amid a busy year-end run of central bank meetings from Ottawa and Frankfurt to Tokyo and London that showed heightened uncertainty ahead of Donald Trump entering the White House in the new year.

Indeed, Fed officials not only dialled back projections for rate cuts in the face of stubborn inflation, Chair Jerome Powell said some in the bank were also trying to judge how Trump's planned tariffs, lower taxes and immigration curbs might affect policy.

The upshot was US central bankers pencilled in estimates for higher growth next year than previously estimated, but also notably higher inflation.

That left Powell repeatedly urging "caution" around additional rate cuts from here, which triggered a slide in stock prices and a recalibration of market estimates for further easing. Just a single Fed rate cut is now priced in for 2025.

"Some people did take a very preliminary step and started to incorporate highly conditional estimates of economic effects of policies into their forecasts at this meeting," Powell said when asked if Trump's policies factored into officials' thinking.

"Some people said they didn't do so, and some people didn't say whether they did or not. So we have people making a bunch of different approaches to that but some did identify policy uncertainty as one of the reasons for their writing down more uncertainty around inflation."

In Asia, The Bank of Japan on Thursday kept ultra-low interest rates as the threat of Trump's policies cast a shadow over the export-reliant economy.

"Uncertainty surrounding Japan's economy and prices remains high," the BOJ said in a statement announcing the decision.

A Reuters survey of Japanese businesses published last week showed nearly three-quarters expect Trump to have a negative effect on their operating environment, something BOJ officials may have to reckon with as the world's lone developed central bank is still trying to tighten policy.

Ahead of the Fed decision, rates had already been lowered last week by the European Central Bank and Bank of Canada, with both expected to deliver some additional easing in 2025 amid weakening outlooks.

While ECB President Christine Lagarde was vague about further rate cuts, she went out of her way to emphasize downside risks to growth, including from prospective trade tensions with the United States under Trump.

Rate decisions are still due in the coming hours from central banks in Sweden, Norway and the United Kingdom.

UPHEAVAL

Although Trump may have been just at the periphery of officials' thinking at the Fed, he was a central focus in Ottawa when Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland quit after clashing with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on how to handle possible US tariffs under the next US administration.

Freeland said the threat of new US tariffs represented a grave danger after Trump last month warned he would issue levies on goods imported from Canada and Mexico of 25% unless the two neighbours limit the flow of migrants and fentanyl into the US.

"That means keeping our fiscal powder dry today, so we have the reserves we may need for a tariff war. That means eschewing costly political gimmicks, which we can ill afford," she wrote in a letter to Trudeau posted on X.

Meanwhile, crypto market enthusiasm for Trump's notion of establishing a strategic reserve of bitcoin was dealt a setback when Powell said the Fed had no legal authority to hold it, adding declaratively that it had no plan to seek a change in the law so that it could.

"That's the kind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed," Powell said.

The remark contributed to a broad slide in crypto-related assets, including a 5% drop in bitcoin itself, its largest decline in more than three months.



Title: IMF agrees to release $650mn for Bangladesh’s fourth loan tranche

Bangladesh reaches agreement with the international lender on additional $750mn funding

The International Monetary Fund, or IMF, has agreed to release $650 million for Bangladesh as part of the fourth tranche of its loan programme.

In addition, the international lender has reached a staff-level agreement with the Bangladesh to provide an extra $750 million in funding.

The additional financing aims to support the country’s foreign currency reserves, facilitate financial sector reforms, and help manage increasing economic pressures.

If approved by the IMF Executive Board, Bangladesh's total loan amount under the programme will increase from $4.7 billion to $5.3 billion.

As per the earlier plan, Bangladesh was scheduled to receive the loan in equal instalments by 2026.

The IMF team announced the agreement in a press release on Wednesday, following discussions with different government agencies, including the Bangladesh Bank, during their visit to Dhaka.

The release of the fourth tranche and approval of the new loan will depend on the decision of the IMF Executive Board, which will review the delegation's findings in an upcoming meeting.

The Washington-based financial institution concluded its meetings with policymakers and officials after a 13-strong delegation, headed by Chris Papageorgiou, assessed the implementation of policies during their visit from Dec 4 to Dec 18.

“Following the evaluation of the third tranche, we have reached an understanding with the Bangladeshi authorities on implementing the required policies. The final decision rests with the IMF Board,” said Chris.

Bangladesh Bank spokesperson Husne Ara Shikha confirmed to bdnews24.com that the country will receive $650 million in the fourth tranche.



Title: Asia wary of Fed rate outlook, high bond yields

Interest rates are expected to fall in the United States and Sweden, and hold steady in Japan, the UK and Norway

Asian share markets were in a wary mood on Monday as surging bond yields challenged equity valuations, particularly for the richly priced tech sector, in a week packed with central bank meetings and major economic data.

Interest rates are expected to fall in the United States and Sweden, and hold steady in Japan, the UK and Norway.

The Federal Reserve will lead the pack on Wednesday with markets pricing a 96% probability it will cut rates by 25 basis points to a new range of 4.25% to 4.50%.

More important will be any guidance on future easing, including the "dot plot" forecasts of Fed members for rates over the next couple of years.

"We look for the updated dots to signal a median expectation for three cuts next year, down from four in the September projection," said JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli. "The median longer-run dot, which was 2.875% in September, we see moving up to 3% or maybe even 3.125%."

"That said, given the vagaries of trade and other policies next year, the signal from the dots may be even less useful than ordinarily."

Investors have been steadily scaling back expectations of how far rates may fall, in part reflecting solid economic news and speculation President-elect Donald Trump's plans for tax cuts and tariffs would expand government borrowing while putting upward pressure on inflation.

Futures imply only two more cuts next year and rates bottoming out around 3.80%, much higher than just a few months ago. That outlook took a heavy toll on the Treasury market last week, where longer-dated yields recorded their largest weekly rise this year.

Yields on 10-year notes were up at 4.39%, having climbed 24 basis points last week alone, and threatening to breach a major bear target at 4.50%.

Rising yields make bonds more attractive versus equities while lifting the level that future cash flows are discounted at and possibly the cost of capital for companies.

Bitcoin grabbed the spotlight in early Asian trade on Monday, surging to a record high above $105,000 as it extended gains on bets Trump's return will usher in a cryptocurrency-friendly regulatory environment.

S&P 500 futures were a fraction lower on Monday, while Nasdaq futures eased 0.1%.

CHINA STRUGGLES

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was little changed, having been flat last week.

Japan's Nikkei edged up 0.1%, while South Korea bounced 0.7% on pledges of government support.

China's blue chip index took a hit on Friday as investors awaited more detail on possible stimulus steps.

Over the weekend, an official at China's central bank said it had room to further cut the reserve requirement ratio, though credit numbers out last week showed past easing had done little to boost borrowing.

Figures on Chinese retail sales, industrial production and house prices for November are due out later Monday.

A range of surveys on global manufacturing are also due Monday, while US retail sales is due on Tuesday and a major inflation report on Friday.

The Bank of Japan, Bank of England and Norges Bank are expected to stand pat on Thursday, while the Riksbank is seen cutting rates and perhaps by 50 basis points.

In currency markets, the dollar has been underpinned by rising yields and put the squeeze on a raft of emerging market currencies, forcing intervention in some cases.

The dollar likewise held firm on the yen at 153.53 , having jumped almost 2.5% last week. The dollar index stood at 106.870 , after rising 0.9% last week.

The euro looked wobbly at $1.0508 , not helped by news ratings agency Moody's unexpectedly downgraded France on Friday.

The action came a few hours after French President Macron appointed veteran centrist Francois Bayrou as the country’s fourth premier in a year.

Political uncertainty was also clouding South Korea where the finance ministry vowed to support markets after President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached.

A firm dollar combined with higher bond yields to restrain gold at $2,685 an ounce.

Bitcoin was having better luck, breaking above $105,000 for the first time and was last fetching $104,955.

Oil prices were supported around three-week highs by expectations that additional sanctions on Russia and Iran could tighten supplies.

Brent was down 2 cents at $74.47 a barrel, while US crude eased 12 cents to $71.17 per barrel.



Title: ADP progress rate for first 5 months sinks to lowest in 15 years

Experts blame the slowdown to political disruptions, power transition, a worsening law and order, and administrative reshuffles

Bangladesh’s development work, which slowed down during the power transition, has not regained momentum, impacting the implementation of the interim government’s ADP under a “go-slow” policy.

In the five months to November of the current 2024-25 fiscal year, ADP implementation reached 12.29 percent compared with 17.06 percent during the same period last year – marking a decline of 4.77 percentage points.

According to data released by the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division, or IMED, of the planning ministry, ADP progress in the first five months has not been this low in the last 15 fiscal years.

Experts attribute the slowdown to disruptions caused by political movements, the power transition in August, a worsening law and order, and administrative reshuffles, which have collectively hindered the implementation of government development programmes.

According to the latest statistics released by the IMED, Tk 342.14 billion was spent under the ADP during the July-November period of the current fiscal year. This is significantly lower than the Tk 468.57 billion spent during the same period last fiscal year.

In percentage terms, the lowest ADP implementation rate was 16.84 percent in the 2015-16 fiscal year.

The deposed Awami League government had allocated roughly Tk 2.78 trillion for the ADP in the current fiscal year when the budget was passed.

After the Awami League was removed from power, the interim government prioritised project implementation based on necessity. As a result, funding for many projects initiated by the previous government was reduced, leading to the suspension of several ongoing projects. Consequently, overall ADP expenditure declined, according to relevant officials.

The latest IMED report reveals that the implementation rate for November was 4.40 percent, or Tk 122.36 billion, compared with 5.52 percent in November of the 2023-24 fiscal year. Typically, ADP spending is lower in the early months of a fiscal year, but political instability has further reduced the rate this time.

In the previous fiscal years—2020-21, 2021-22, and 2022-23—the ADP implementation rates for the first five months were 17.93 percent, 18.61 percent, and 18.41 percent, respectively.

Speaking at a workshop on Monday, Prof M Abu Yusuf of the Development Studies Department at Dhaka University noted that the decline in ADP implementation is "not surprising" given the current circumstances.

A member of the White Paper Committee on the economy, he added: "However, the interim government must consider how to provide relief to the general public during this period of high inflation."

Despite being in office for four months, Prof Yusuf noted, the government has yet to provide clear guidelines on how the annual programme of planned public sector projects should proceed, he added.

"If just 2.3 percent of the current fiscal year’s budget were reallocated to three key food-based social safety net programmes, it would double the allocation for these initiatives," he explained.

The three key programmes—combining urban and rural areas—are the Food-Friendly Programme, or FFP, Open Market Sales, or OMS, and Food for Work, or FFW.



Title: Future tax incentives for businesses will be reduced, says Salehuddin

The finance advisor points out the failure of regulatory bodies to act against rule-breakers

Finance Advisor Salehuddin Ahmed has suggested reducing the incentives or tax breaks currently offered to businesses in the future.

"It is not possible to keep giving tax breaks forever. Logical taxes must be paid, and only reasonable exemptions will be granted,” he said during the annual conference of the International Business Forum of Bangladesh, or IBFB, in Dhaka on Sunday.

Referring to discussions with the International Monetary Fund, or IMF, Salehuddin said: “This morning, we had a meeting with the IMF. They are saying that tax exemptions must be reduced.”

The advisor said Bangladesh cricket all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan should have been fined two years ago for market manipulation.

He also pointed out that regulatory bodies such as Bangladesh Bank and the National Board of Revenue, or NBR, had failed to curb corruption.

“Banks, financial institutions, businessmen, and different organisations have broken the law, but no appropriate actions have been taken against them," said Salehuddin.

He added, "So, the blame cannot only be placed on politicians; these regulatory bodies are also at fault."

Salehuddin, the former governor of the Bangladesh Bank, highlighted that regulatory bodies had manipulated data on multiple occasions.

"Qualified people were not allowed to work in these areas. Even when they wanted to, their efforts were blocked by undue influence," he said.



Title: Italy sees weaker 2024 GDP, with industrial sector in trouble, economy minister says

The government in September set an unadjusted 1% growth target for this year

Italy will likely end this year with an annual economic growth rate of 0.7%, Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti said on Thursday, warning that the industrial sector risked slumping.

Speaking at a political event promoted by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy party, Giorgetti said the estimate was adjusted for the number of days worked.

The government in September set an unadjusted 1% growth target for this year.

Giorgetti said the disappointing performance of Germany's economy was weighing on Italy, adding that the industry sector was the main cause of concern for the government.

"We see signs of a nosedive," he said.

However, the GDP downward revision "doesn't change our public finance targets," the minister added.

Italy hopes to bring its deficit below the European Union's 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) ceiling in 2026 from 3.8 targeted this year.

Part of the lower-than-expected growth is also related to delays in spending European Union's post-COVID recovery funds, which has impacted the economy.

Italy is due to receive 194.4 billion euros ($203.81 billion) in cheap loans and grants from the bloc's Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) by 2026, more than any other state in absolute terms.

Speaking at the same event on Thursday, EU Affairs Minister Tommaso Foti said Italy wanted to replace some planned projects that Rome will be unable to complete by the 2026 deadline, with others that could be wrapped up within the allowed timeframe.

"We are going towards a rescheduling next February," Foti said.

To support the economy, the government wants to cut the IRES corporate tax for those companies that make investments and new hirings under certain conditions.

The measure has an estimated cost of around 400 million euros, which Giorgetti said Rome planned to cover by seeking an additional contributions from banks.

Italy expects to raise more than 5 billion euros from the financial sector over the next three years through a package of measures already included in the government's 2025 budget.



Title: US regulator's 'problem bank' list grows as industry profits dip

The total assets for banks on that list climbed $3.9 billion to $87.3 billion, the FDIC said

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) logo is seen in this photo.  www.investopedia.com

A top US bank regulator added two banks to its so-called "problem bank" list in the third quarter, while overall industry profits dipped 8.6%, the regulator said.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation typically does not identify firms that are added to the list, which includes banks that have received particularly low confidential scores from bank supervisors. FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg said the overall level of problem banks, now totaling 68 firms or 1.5% of all banks, is "not atypical."

The total assets for banks on that list climbed $3.9 billion to $87.3 billion, the FDIC said.

On Thursday, the FDIC reported quarterly profits for the banking sector were down slightly after banks enjoyed a one-time surge in the prior quarter.

The slightly lower profits were primarily due to the fact that banks reported one-time gains on equity security transactions in the second quarter. But those missing funds were partially offset by strong net interest income and growing revenue, the regulator said in its quarterly profit report. Bank profits were up slightly when compared with first-quarter numbers.

"The banking industry continued to show resilience in the third quarter. Net interest income and the net interest margin increased substantially this quarter," Gruenberg said in a prepared statement.

There were some signs of caution in the latest figures. The ratio of past-due or non-accrual loans in the commercial real estate sector ticked up to 2.07%, the highest level recorded since 2013, as borrowers continue to grapple with high levels of office vacancies following the COVID-19 pandemic.

Overall though, the latest FDIC report suggests stability in the banking sector. Net interest income rose by $4.5 billion in the quarter, the net interest margin was up for banks of all sizes, and deposits rose 1.1% to $194.6 billion. Unrealised losses on securities fell 29%, as overall interest rates fell.



Title: Bangladeshi expats send over $2 billion remittance in three weeks of December

It marks five consecutive months with over $2 billion in remittances

In the first 21 days of December 2024, expatriates have sent nearly $2.07 billion in remittances to their families and beneficiaries.

In contrast, $1.72 billion was received in the first 23 days of November.

Throughout the entire month of November, $2.19 billion in remittances came through banking channels.

On Sunday, Bangladesh Bank released an updated report revealing that remittances exceeded $2 billion in three weeks, marking five consecutive months with over $2 billion in remittances.

Since April this year, expatriates have been sending more than $2 billion each month, with the exception of July when the figure dipped below this threshold.

Commenting on the upward trend, Syed Mahbubur Rahman, managing director of Mutual Trust Bank, told bdnews24.com: "The remittance rate through banking channels has increased from before, which is why more remittances are coming."

In addition to a 2.5 percent incentive, expatriates are receiving over Tk120 per dollar when sending money through banks. Bankers believe this has significantly boosted remittances through banking channels.

In May of this year, the central bank introduced the "crawling peg" system to determine the dollar exchange rate, causing the dollar rate to jump from Tk 110 to 117. Later, the remittance rate through banking channels was set at Tk 120 per dollar.

Thanks to the positive trend in remittances, $11.11 billion was received during the five months from July to November of the current 2024–25 fiscal year.

This marks a 26.40 percent increase compared with $8.79 billion during the same period in the previous fiscal year.



Title: WB, ADB to give $1.1bn in support for Yunus govt

The interim government hopes the funds will be made available to them in December

The Ministry of Finance says that the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have approved $1.1 billion in budget support for the interim government led by Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus.

The government hopes the funds will be made available this December.

The WB has approved two budget support funds amounting to $500 million and the ADB has approved $600 million in support to accelerate the interim government’s reform and development activities.

In addition to the budget support, the WB has also approved $379 million for the health and nutrition sector and $280 million in project support for developing the water supply system in Chattogram.

Title: Inflation figures are not manipulated, reflect reality: Finance Advisor Salehuddin

The finance advisor dismisses claims of manipulation, clarifies the causes behind rising inflation rates

Finance Advisor Salehuddin Ahmed has clarified that the rising inflation rate is a true reflection of the economy, rejecting claims of manipulation.

He explained that the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, or BBS, was instructed to release the data that was available, with no attempt to hide information.

Speaking at the launch of the sixth edition of the Banking Almanac at Dhaka's CIRDAP auditorium on Saturday, Salehuddin acknowledged past discrepancies in data related to inflation and gross domestic product, or GDP, attributing them to both unintentional mistakes and attempts by policymakers to conceal information.

Despite multiple interest rate hikes, inflation has continued to rise in Bangladesh, hitting 11.38 percent in November, up from 10.87 percent in the previous month.

This means that a basket of goods and services that cost Tk 100 in November 2023 would cost Tk 111.38 in November 2024.

The finance advisor said that the interim government is not here to show off its capacity, but to address discrepancies in the last 15 years of data.

He said efforts are underway to correct and revise this information, which was previously concealed.

He also said donor organisations have raised questions about the issue, but the interim government have clarifying that the earlier data was hidden and that they are now presenting the correct figures.

The advisor also highlighted issues in the capital markets, criticising investors for buying worthless "Z-category" shares with no real value, warning that these will soon become worthless.

He urged investors to be cautious and criticised market players and regulators for their roles in the ongoing issues.



Title: Reserves reach $20 billion as Bangladesh Bank buys dollars to meet IMF conditions

Bangladesh Bank aims for $15.30 billion in net reserves by December end

Foreign exchange reserves have risen sharply within a week as the central bank purchased dollars from commercial banks to meet the International Monetary Fund, or IMF, conditions.

Bangladesh Bank said foreign exchange reserves stood at $19.95 billion under the BPM-6 method, up from $19.20 billion on Dec 11—an increase of $753 million in a week.

A senior central bank official told bdnews24.com: “Bangladesh Bank wants to increase its net reserves to $15.30 billion by the end of December in compliance with the IMF conditions.

“That is why it is buying from commercial banks instead of selling dollars.”

When asked if the reserves were rising due to dollar purchases, Bangladesh Bank Executive Director and Spokesperson Husne Ara Shikha told bdnews24.com: “I will not explain how the reserves are increasing.”

The central bank's dollar purchases have caused the value of the US currency to rise against the taka.

On Wednesday, some private banks bought remittances at Tk 126.50 to Tk 127, up from Tk 120 a month earlier, while money exchanges sold dollars at even higher rates.

Another official said: “Many banks are selling dollars to the central bank instead of the interbank market, and foreign exchange houses are also selling dollars to banks at higher rates.”

Last month, the reserves fell to $18 billion due to the payment of import liabilities through the Asian Clearing Union, or ACU.

As remittances and export earnings flowed in, reserves rose, though they remained below levels seen when the Sheikh Hasina government fell in August.

Bangladesh Bank reported $20.48 billion in reserves on Jul 30, a figure that remained unchanged on Aug 21.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, reserves peaked at a record $48 billion.

However, rising global fuel and food prices, coupled with the Ukraine war, drove up import costs, leading to a steady decline in reserves since 2022.

In the past two fiscal years, Bangladesh Bank sold dollars from reserves to facilitate government Letters of Credit, or LCs, for commercial banks, further depleting foreign exchange reserves.

Following Hasina’s departure, Ahsan H Mansur assumed the role of Bangladesh Bank governor.

At a press conference, he announced a halt to dollar sales from reserves, saying this would boost reserves and eliminate the risk of further decline.

However, reserves have yet to cross the $20 billion mark even after four months, despite repeated assurances from Bangladesh Bank about their growth.



Title: Fourth tranche of IMF loan may arrive in February

The overall picture of Bangladesh's economy is still not very promising, the IMF delegation says

The International Monetary Fund, or IMF, will release the fourth tranche of its ongoing loan programme, amounting to $645 million, following the approval the executive board at a meeting in February.

Chris Papageorgiou, chief of the Development Macroeconomics Division in the Research Department of the IMF, made the announcement at a press conference at the finance ministry on Thursday.

Before the release of the fourth instalment, a 13-strong delegation came to review the progress of the reform proposals made by the IMF on Bangladesh’s economy.

Before returning, they held a press conference at the ministry.

Regarding the release of the money, the head of the IMF delegation said the proposal for the release of the tranche will be raised at the IMF Executive Board meeting on Feb 5. It will be distributed once it is approved.

Papageorgiou said, “The overall picture of Bangladesh's economy is still not very promising. Inflation remains out of control for a long time. The current inflation rate of 9.6 percent is much higher than the IMF's estimate. Bangladesh Bank will have to play a more active role in controlling the crisis.”

He said the IMF is positive about providing assistance to Bangladesh. However, the growth of domestic income and the reform of the banking sector must continue.

Regarding the printing of new currency notes, he said: “The printing of new money is also a matter of concern. It may bring a temporary relief, but not for a long time.”



Title: Bangladesh Bank looks at 'new mechanism' as dollar rates crawl up

"We didn't expect dollar prices to increase this much. It rose to Tk 127-128. Besides, Bangladesh Bank isn't selling dollars," says the managing director of Citizens Bank

As the demand in the import sector jumps ahead of Ramadan and the central bank preparing to boost its reserves, the price of the dollar has gone up.

Although Bangladesh Bank fixed the exchange rate at Tk 120, some private banks bought remittances at Tk 126.50 to Tk 127 on Tuesday. The money changing houses also sold dollars at a raised rate.

In consideration of the overall situation, Bangladesh Bank is pondering launching a 'new mechanism,' said its spokesperson Executive Director Husne Ara Shikha. A circular will be issued in this regard on Thursday, she said.

Demand for imports have surged as Ramadan looms in March. On the other hand, Bangladesh Bank aims to push net reserves up to $15.30 billion at the end of December to meet the condition imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). As such, instead of selling, the central bank is purchasing dollars from the commercial banks. Under the circumstances, inflation, which was already increased in November, may increase further due to a hike in import prices.

"Dollar prices went up mainly because of the increased demand in the import business," said BB spokesperson Shikha.

There are a few reasons behind the exchange rate hike, a senior official at the central bank told bdnews24.com. "Mainly, the banks are increasing imports with the coming of Ramadan. This has pushed up the demand for dollars. However, the remittance and export flow is not enough to match the import demand," he explained.

Moreover, the central bank is purchasing dollars from commercial banks to increase its foreign currency reserves. Hence, many banks are selling dollars to Bangladesh Bank, instead of selling at the interbank level. "The foreign exchange houses are also selling dollars at an increased rate."

Banks purchase dollars from two sources - remitters and exporters, said the treasury head of a private bank.

The dollars bought from the exporters usually cost Tk 119 to Tk 120, while remittances are purchased at a slightly higher price. The authorities open LCs using an average of these two prices.

"Bangladesh Bank usually sells dollars to other banks, which it has halted for now. Instead, it is buying dollars from the banks to increase the reserves. Also, more LCs are opened before Ramadan. Hence, the banks need more dollars," the treasury head added.

"We didn't expect dollar prices to increase this much. It rose to Tk 127-128. Besides, Bangladesh Bank isn't selling dollars," said the managing director of Citizens Bank Mohammad Masum.

Masum said that one of the reasons behind the price hike was the surging demand for opening LCs in the import business. "On the other side, the IMF imposed a condition that the reserves shouldn't drop. Which means that the net reserve level should be maintained."

"If a bank buys remittances at a higher rate, it can't sell dollars at a lower rate. Nobody runs their business for losses. As per the law, you can't face financial loss in a foreign exchange business. This is an offence as per the banking law. Hence, the price is surging as the supply isn't sufficient," said a deputy managing director of a bank on condition of anonymity.

Inflation may rise further in mid-December with the rising exchange rate and hike in import costs. According to the updated information of the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), inflation stood at 11.38 percent in November. The figure was 10.87 percent the month before.

Bangladesh Bank introduced a ‘crawling peg,’ system for the exchange rate in May this year. This resulted in the rate jumping by Tk 7 and reached Tk 117. Then the rate was fixed at Tk 120 using the ‘crawling peg,’ system. Now Bangladesh Bank is looking into new options to address the exchange rate hike.
