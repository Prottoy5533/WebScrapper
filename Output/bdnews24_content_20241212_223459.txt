President-elect Donald Trump is now considering tapping Richard Grenell, his former intelligence chief, to be a special envoy for Iran, according to two people familiar with the transition plans.

&quot;He&#39;s definitely in the running,&quot; said a person familiar with transition deliberations, who asked not to be identified.

No final decisions on either personnel or strategy on Iran have been made official yet by Trump, including whether to slap fresh sanctions on the country, pursue diplomacy or both in order to halt their nuclear program.

Trump&#39;s plans for the role have not previously been reported. Neither Trump&#39;s team nor Grenell responded to requests for comment.

&quot;Richard Grenell is a fabulous person, A STAR. He will be someplace, high up!&quot; Trump said in a post on his social media platform late Wednesday following the Reuters report.

Grenell, in a separate post on X, called the report &quot;wrong&quot; but gave no other details.

Still, Trump&#39;s consideration of a key ally for such a posting sends a signal to the region that the new US president may be open to talks with a country he has previously threatened and whose elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps have sought to assassinate him, according to the US government. Iran has denied the claim.

In the role, Grenell is expected to be tasked with speaking with countries in and beyond the region about the Iran issue as well as taking Tehran&#39;s temperature on possible negotiations, said one of the people.

Iran&#39;s President Masoud Pezeshkian, who is viewed as relatively moderate, said following Trump&#39;s election that Tehran must &quot;deal with the US&quot; and &quot;manage&quot; relations with its arch-foe.

Iran has suffered a series of strategic setbacks, including Israel&#39;s assault on Tehran&#39;s proxy militias Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon and the ouster of Iranian ally Bashar al-Assad in Syria.

But tensions remain high more than a year after Hamas attacked southern Israel, launching the Gaza war. Meanwhile, other Iranian proxies have attacked US, Israeli and other Western targets, and Tehran has accelerated its nuclear program while limiting the UN nuclear watchdog&#39;s ability to monitor it.

It&#39;s not the first job Trump has considered for Grenell, who served as Trump&#39;s ambassador to Germany, a special presidential envoy for Serbia and Kosovo peace negotiations, and as acting director of national intelligence during Trump&#39;s 2017-2021 term.

After campaigning for Trump in the lead up to the Nov 5 election, he was a top contender to be secretary of state and for special envoy for the Ukraine war. Those jobs went to US Senator Marco Rubio and retired lieutenant general Keith Kellogg, respectively. Trump takes office next month.

During his first term in office, in 2020, Trump ordered a US air strike that killed Iran&#39;s top military commander, Qassem Soleimani.

Trump in 2018 also reneged on a nuclear deal struck by his predecessor Barack Obama in 2015 and re-imposed US economic sanctions on Iran that had been relaxed. The deal had limited Iran&#39;s ability to enrich uranium, a process that can yield fissile material for nuclear weapons.

Iran now is &quot;dramatically&quot; accelerating enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% level that is weapons grade, the UN nuclear watchdog chief told Reuters last week. Iran says its nuclear program only serves peaceful purposes.

The United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly voted on Wednesday to demand an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas in the Gaza Strip and the immediate release of all hostages.

The ceasefire demand in the resolution - adopted with 158 votes in favour in the 193-member assembly - was expressed in more urgent language than one urging an immediate humanitarian truce in Gaza that the body &quot;called for&quot; in October 2023 then &quot;demanded&quot; in December 2023.

General Assembly resolutions are not binding but carry political weight, reflecting a global view on the war. The United States, Israel and seven other countries voted against the ceasefire resolution, while 13 countries abstained.

The world body also threw its support behind the UN Palestinian relief agency UNRWA, adopting a second resolution with 159 votes in favour to deplore a new Israeli law that will ban UNRWA&#39;s operations in Israel from late January.

It demanded that Israel respect UNRWA&#39;s mandate and &quot;enable its operations to proceed without impediment or restriction.&quot; The US, Israel and seven other countries voted no, while 11 countries abstained.

&quot;The messages we send to the world through these resolutions matter. And both of these resolutions have significant problems,&quot; Deputy US Ambassador to the UN Robert Wood told the assembly.

&quot;One rewards Hamas and downplays the need to release the hostages, and the other denigrates Israel without providing a path forward to increasing humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians,&quot; he said.

Israel&#39;s UN Ambassador Danny Danon last week accused the UN of having &quot;an obsession with vilifying Israel,&quot; while Palestinian UN envoy Riyad Mansour described Gaza as the &quot;open, painful wound for the human family.&quot;

&#39;HUNGER, DESPAIR, DEATH&#39;

Israel says UNRWA staff took part in the Oct 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, which sparked the war in Gaza. The UN has said nine UNRWA staff may have been involved and had been fired. A Hamas commander in Lebanon - killed by Israel - was also found to have had an UNRWA job.

&quot;By voting for these resolutions, you are not voting to protect humanitarian values, but to protect an organization that has become a haven for terror,&quot; Danon told the assembly on Wednesday before the vote.

UNRWA was established by the General Assembly in 1949 following the war surrounding the founding of Israel. The UN has repeatedly said there is no alternative to UNRWA, which provides aid, health and education to millions of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.

&quot;Gaza doesn&#39;t exist anymore. It is destroyed. Palestinians are facing hunger, despair and death,&quot; Slovenia&#39;s UN Ambassador Samuel Zbogar told the assembly. &quot;There is no reason for this war to continue. We need a ceasefire now. We need to bring hostages home now.&quot;

The war in the Palestinian enclave began after Hamas gunmen on Oct 7, 2023, stormed into Israeli communities, killing around 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages back to Hamas-run Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.

Since then, Israel&#39;s military has levelled swathes of Gaza, driving nearly all of its 2.3 million people from their homes, giving rise to deadly hunger and disease and killing more than 44,800 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, who do not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants.

The main commander of the fighters who toppled Bashar al-Assad said on Wednesday that he would dissolve the security forces of the former regime, close its prisons and hunt down anyone involved in the torture or killing of detainees.

Syrian rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa - better known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani - said in a statement to Reuters he will &quot;dissolve the security forces of the previous regime and close the notorious prisons.&quot;

Syria ran one of the most oppressive police states in the Middle East during five decades of Assad family rule. Sharaa, whose former al Qaeda affiliate Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) is now the country&#39;s most powerful force, must balance demands for justice from victims with the need to prevent violent reprisals and secure international aid.

Syrians have flocked to the infamous prisons where the Assad regime is estimated to have held tens of thousands of detainees, desperately looking for their loved ones. Some have been released alive, others were identified among the dead and thousands more have not yet been found.

Sharaa said in a separate statement on the Syrian state TV&#39;s Telegram channel that people who took part in the torture or killing of detainees would be hunted down, and pardons were out of the question.

&quot;We will pursue them in Syria, and we ask countries to hand over those who fled so we can achieve justice,&quot; said Sharaa.

The world is carefully watching to see if Syria&#39;s new rulers can stabilise the country and avoid unleashing violent revenge, after a 13-year civil war fought along sectarian and ethnic lines.

Since Assad&#39;s fall, 27-year-old Hayat al-Turki has been searching the abandoned cells of Syria&#39;s most notorious prison, the vast Sednaya complex, for any sign of her missing relatives, including her brother who vanished 14 years ago.

&quot;I was hopeful and optimistic to find someone from my missing prisoners - a brother, an uncle or a cousin - but I did not... I searched the whole prison,&quot; she said.

Mohammad al-Bashir, the man installed by Sharaa&#39;s fighters to lead an interim administration until March, said he aimed to bring back millions of refugees, create unity and provide basic services.

But the new administration has scant resources, he told Italian newspaper Il Corriere della Sera.

&quot;We have no foreign currency and as for loans and bonds we are still collecting data. So yes, financially we are very bad,&quot; said Bashir, who previously ran a small rebel-led administration in a pocket of northwestern Syria.

Rebuilding Syria is a colossal task following the civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of people, reduced cities to ruins and left the economy gutted by international sanctions. Millions of refugees still live in camps after one of the biggest displacements of modern times.

ENGAGING WARILY

Foreign officials are warily engaging with the former rebels, although HTS remains designated a terrorist organisation by Washington, the United Nations, EU and others.

The new government must &quot;uphold clear commitments to fully respect the rights of minorities, facilitate the flow of humanitarian assistance to all in need, prevent Syria from being used as a base for terrorism or posing a threat to its neighbours,&quot; US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.

US Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer told Reuters Washington remains cautious.

&quot;We have seen over the years any number of militant groups who have ... promised that they would govern in an inclusive way, and then see them fail to meet those promises,&quot; State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.

In addition to terrorism bans in place against the former rebels, Syria also remains under US, European and other financial sanctions imposed against Damascus under Assad.

Two senior US congressmen, a Republican and a Democrat, wrote a letter calling for Washington to suspend some sanctions. The most punishing war-time US sanctions are up for renewal this month, and the former rebels have told Reuters they are in touch with Washington about potentially easing them.

Spain&#39;s Foreign Minister Jose Luis Albares on Wednesday said at the Reuters NEXT conference that he expected the UN and European Union to discuss easing sanctions and removing HTS from lists of terrorist organisations.

The international community must quickly demand that the rebel forces transform into a political movement and respect human rights, he added.

&quot;We must move very fast because in a month, probably, decisions will have already been taken in Damascus and we will not be able to have the impact that we can have today,&quot; Albares said.

With the administration of US President Joe Biden entering its final weeks in office, Blinken and US national security adviser Jake Sullivan headed to the Middle East on Wednesday to work on a Gaza ceasefire and help ensure a smooth transition in Syria, US officials said. Their separate itineraries include stops in Jordan, Turkey, Israel, Qatar and Egypt.

For refugees, the prospect of returning home has brought a mixture of joy and grief over hardship in exile. Syrians lined up at the Turkish border on Wednesday to head home, speaking of their expectations for a better life following what was for many a decade of hardship in Turkey.

&quot;We have no one here. We are going back to Latakia, where we have family,&quot; said Mustafa as he prepared to enter Syria with his wife and three sons at the Cilvegozu border gate in southern Turkey. Dozens more Syrians were waiting to cross.

FBI Director Chris Wray will step down from his post early next year, the bureau said on Wednesday, after Republican President-elect Donald Trump signaled his intent to fire the veteran official and replace him with firebrand Kash Patel.

Trump himself had appointed Wray, a fellow Republican, to his 10-year term in 2017, after firing his predecessor James Comey, who the then-president soured on over the FBI&#39;s investigations into alleged contacts between his 2016 campaign and Russia.

&quot;After weeks of careful thought, I&rsquo;ve decided the right thing for the Bureau is for me to serve until the end of the current Administration in January and then step down,&quot; Wray told FBI employees today, the agency said in a statement.

In a statement to Reuters, Patel said he looks forward to a &quot;smooth transition.&quot;

&quot;I will be ready to serve the American people on day one,&quot; he said.

Trump and his hardline allies turned on Wray, and the FBI more generally, after agents conducted a court-approved search of Trump&#39;s Florida resort in 2022 to recover classified documents that he had retained after leaving office.

That sparked one of two federal prosecutions Trump faced while out of power, neither of which went to trial. Trump denied wrongdoing and described all the cases against him as politically motivated. Federal prosecutors ended their efforts after his election, citing longstanding Justice Department policy not to prosecute a sitting president.

Trump&#39;s Republican allies joined him in alleging that the FBI had become politicized, though there is no evidence that Democratic President Joe Biden interfered with its investigative processes.

&quot;There are serious problems at the FBI. The American public knows it. They expect to see sweeping change,&quot; Republican US Senator Bill Hagerty said in early December after Trump&#39;s nomination of Patel.

Throughout his term, Wray said that he followed the law and strove to impartially carry out the FBI&#39;s duties. During a 2023 hearing before a House of Representatives panel he rebuffed the idea that he was pursuing a Democratic partisan agenda, noting that he had been a lifelong Republican.

&quot;The idea that I am biased against conservatives seems somewhat insane to me, given my own personal background,&quot; Wray said.

FBI directors are appointed for 10-year terms, a measure meant to avoid the appearance of partisanship after political turnover in the White House every four years.

Wray&#39;s term was not due to expire until 2027.

As he has built out his roster of Cabinet officials over the past few weeks, Trump has assembled a team ready to carry out two of his biggest priorities: retribution against his political adversaries and a wholesale reshaping of the US government.

Patel, who would need to be confirmed by the US Senate, has never worked at the FBI and only spent three years at the Justice Department earlier in his career in the National Security Division&#39;s Counterterrorism Section. If confirmed, he has pledged to shut down the FBI&#39;s headquarters building in Washington and drastically redefine the bureau&#39;s role with intelligence-gathering.

Throughout Trump&#39;s first term, Trump repeatedly mused about the idea of replacing Wray for not being forceful enough in defending him from the 2016 investigation, but former Attorney General Bill Barr resisted such efforts, Barr recounted in his book &quot;One Damn Thing After Another.&quot;

Wray, in his address to employees on Wednesday, urged them to continue to focus on their mission to keep Americans safe.

&quot;My goal is to keep the focus on  our mission &mdash; the indispensable work you&rsquo;re doing on behalf of the American people every day,&quot; Wray said, according to excerpts provided by the bureau.

&quot;In my view, this is the best way to avoid dragging the bureau deeper into the fray, while reinforcing the values and principles that are so important to how we do our work.&quot;

FISA WARRANTS, JAN 6 PROBES

The FBI has faced increasing criticism by Trump&#39;s supporters for its various roles in investigating Trump over the years.

Some of the concerns pre-dated Wray&#39;s tenure, including several damning reports by the Justice Department&#39;s inspector general which faulted the bureau for making numerous errors in its warrant applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court during its early investigation into Trump&#39;s 2016 campaign known as &quot;Crossfire Hurricane.&quot;

During his tenure, Wray has overseen reforms of the FBI&#39;s processes for securing FISA warrants.

The FBI during Wray&#39;s time has also played a major role in helping to investigate and arrest many of Trump&#39;s supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan 6, 2021, in a failed bid to block Congress from certifying Biden&#39;s election victory.

More than 1,500 people were criminally charged in the attack.

Trump has pledged to grant clemency to some of the Jan 6 defendants, though he has not provided details.

Throughout his time as FBI director, Wray has been known for his hawkish views on China, and has frequently warned that China represents the biggest national and economic security threat facing the United States.

Wray started his career at the Justice Department in 1997 as a federal prosecutor in the Atlanta-based Northern District of Georgia.

He was nominated by President George W. Bush in 2003 to lead the department&#39;s Criminal Division, where he oversaw a variety of investigations including post-9/11 efforts to combat terrorism and the Enron Task Force.

Wray also practiced law for about 17 years with the law firm King &amp; Spalding, and he clerked for former Judge J. Michael Luttig in the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit after earning his law degree from Yale Law School.

There are currently 99 million Swiss francs ($112 million) worth of frozen Syrian assets in Switzerland, most of which have been blocked for years, the Swiss government said on Wednesday.

The bulk of the total has been frozen since Switzerland adopted European Union sanctions against Syria in May 2011, the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (Seco) said.

Switzerland this week added three more people to its Syria-related sanctions list, following a move by the EU.

&quot;There are currently 318 individuals and 87 entities on the sanctions list,&quot; a Seco spokesperson told Reuters, declining to say if Switzerland had frozen any assets of ousted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Swiss financial institutions once held blocked Syrian assets worth 130 million Swiss francs ($147 million), the Neue Zuercher Zeitung newspaper reported.

&quot;Fluctuations in the total amount of restricted assets can be explained by several factors, including fluctuations in the value of restricted securities accounts and exchange rate effects and the delisting of certain sanctioned persons or entities,&quot; the Seco spokesperson said.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that Moscow was not ready to make concessions when it came to Ukraine and that President Vladimir Putin&#39;s own proposals on how to end the conflict needed to be implemented.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova made her comments in the context of a call by US President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday for an immediate ceasefire and negotiations between Ukraine and Russia to end &quot;the madness.&quot;

Zakharova said Russia was ready to engage with the new US administration on Ukraine, but had not yet received any serious, workable options to address what she said were Russia&#39;s legitimate security concerns and worries about the rights of Ukraine&#39;s Russian-speaking population.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been pushing hard for his country to be invited to join the NATO military alliance, responded to Trump&#39;s comments by saying Kyiv needed effective security guarantees.

But Zakharova said that anyone who thought Russia would make concessions on Ukraine was mistaken.

&quot;Firstly, Russia is acting. Secondly, if someone expects Russia to make some kind of concessions, apparently these people have a short memory and insufficient knowledge of the matter,&quot; she said.

Putin&#39;s proposals for peace needed to be implemented, she said.

The Kremlin chief has said that Ukraine must not join NATO and that Russia needs the entire territory of the four Ukrainian regions he has said are now part of Russia if there is to be peace.

Russia is one of 10 countries, including the US, China, Britain and Israel, that are developing their own generative AI models

President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia would develop artificial intelligence with BRICS partners and other countries, in a bid to challenge the dominance of the United States in one of the most promising and crucial technologies of the 21st century.

Speaking at Russia&#39;s flagship AI conference, Putin said the new AI Alliance Network would include national associations and development institutions in the field of AI from BRICS countries and other interested states.

&quot;Russia must participate on equal terms in the global race to create strong artificial intelligence. It is precisely the advanced solutions that Russian scientists are currently working on,&quot; Putin told an AI conference in Moscow.

&quot;We invite scientists from all over the world to join in the collaboration,&quot; he added.

Western sanctions intended to restrict Russia&#39;s access to the technologies it needs to sustain its war against Ukraine have resulted in the world&#39;s major producers of microchips halting exports to Russia, sorely limiting its AI ambitions.

Russia&#39;s dominant lender Sberbank is spearheading AI development in Russia, but Sberbank CEO German Gref acknowledged in 2023 that graphics processing units (GPUs), the microchips that underpin AI development, were the trickiest hardware for Russia to replace.

On Wednesday, the bank said national AI associations from BRICS members Brazil, China, India and South Africa, but also from Serbia, Indonesia and other non-BRICS countries, had joined the AI Alliance Network.

It said the network would facilitate joint research into technology and AI regulation, and provide opportunities for AI products to be sold in member countries&#39; markets.

RUSSIA SEEKS TO JOIN LEADING POWERS IN RACE FOR AI SUPREMACY

The United States and China are the world&#39;s top AI powers, and US President-elect Donald Trump has named a &quot;White House AI and Crypto Czar&quot; to help ensure the United States remains the richest and most technologically advanced power in the world.

But Putin&#39;s move to ally with China could change the dynamics of the AI race.

Russia is one of 10 countries, including the US, China, Britain and Israel, that are developing their own generative AI models. The Yakov and Partners consultancy, run by former McKinsey employees in Moscow, says this gives it the potential to become a much more significant player.

Russia sees the use of AI technologies across all sectors adding 11.2 trillion roubles ($109 billion) to gross domestic product in 2030, compared to 0.2 trillion roubles ($1.9 billion) in 2023.

Its AI strategy also says that 80% of all Russian workers should have AI skills by 2030, compared with 5% in 2023, while AI investment should grow seven-fold to 850 billion roubles.

Sberbank, which has developed a generative AI model called GigaChat, and technology leader Yandex YDEX.MM, with its YandexGPT model, dominate Russia&#39;s domestic AI market.

Russia currently ranks 31st of 83 countries by AI implementation, innovation and investment on UK-based Tortoise Media&#39;s Global AI Index, well behind not only the United States and China but also fellow BRICS members India and Brazil.

Stanford University&#39;s AI vibrancy tool, which evaluates 36 countries based on 42 AI indicators including research and development, ranks Russia 29th.

Russia could launch another hypersonic ballistic missile in Ukraine in the coming days, but Washington does not consider the Oreshnik weapon a game-changer in the war, a U.S. official said on Wednesday.

Russia first fired the Oreshnik missile at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Nov. 21, in what President Vladimir Putin cast as a response to Ukraine&#39;s first use of U.S. ATACMs ballistic missiles and British Storm Shadows to strike Russian territory with Western permission.

&quot;We assess that the Oreshnik is not a game-changer on the battlefield, but rather just another attempt by Russia to terrorize Ukraine, which will fail,&quot; the official said.

There was no immediate response from Russia.

Putin has previously said Russia may use the Oreshnik again, including to hit &quot;decision-making centers&quot; in Kyiv, if Ukraine keeps attacking Russia with long-range Western weapons.

Putin has claimed that the Oreshnik, or hazel tree, is impossible to intercept and that it has destructive power comparable to that of a nuclear weapon, even when fitted with a conventional warhead.

Some Western experts have said the novel feature of the Oreshnik was that it carried multiple warheads capable of simultaneously striking different targets - something usually associated with longer-range intercontinental ballistic missiles.

But the U.S. official downplayed the usefulness of the missiles, calling them &quot;experimental&quot; in nature and said that &quot;Russia likely possesses only a handful&quot; of them. The official also said the weapon has a smaller warhead than other missiles Russia has deployed in Ukraine.

Washington says more deliveries of U.S. air defence exports to Ukraine are on the way to the country.

The war is entering what some Russian and Western officials say could be its final and most dangerous phase as Moscow&#39;s forces advance at their fastest pace since the early weeks of the conflict.

President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office next month, has pushed for a ceasefire and negotiations to end the war quickly, leaving Washington&#39;s long-term support for Ukraine in question.

Russia&#39;s 2022 invasion of Ukraine has left tens of thousands of dead, displaced millions and triggered the biggest crisis in relations between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.
