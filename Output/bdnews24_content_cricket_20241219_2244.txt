Title: Afghanistan enjoy record ODI win helped by Atal ton against Zimbabwe

They have scored 286-6, led by Atal's 104 and Malik's 84

Afghanistan recorded their biggest One-Day International victory with a 232-run win against hosts Zimbabwe after opener Sediqullah Atal's maiden ODI century and figures of 3-9 by off-spinner AM Ghazanfar at the Harare Sports Club on Thursday.

After being sent in to bat, Afghanistan amassed 286 for six in their 50 overs, led by Atal’s 104 from 128 balls as part of an opening stand of 191 with Abdul Malik (84 from 101 balls).

Zimbabwe struggled from the start of their reply and were bowled out for 54, the joint lowest Afghanistan have dismissed a side for in ODI cricket. It matches the score they skittled Zimbabwe for at the same venue in 2017.

Afghanistan have a 1-0 lead after two matches in the three-game series with the first fixture rained out. The third and final game is at the Harare Sports Club on Saturday.



Title: India hope misfiring top order will come good after Gabba jailbreak

They snatched a draw in the rain-blighted third Test in Brisbane

A jailbreak at the Gabba has brought a palpable sense of relief in the India camp, while giving rise to hope their misfiring top order will finally come good in more batting-friendly conditions in the final two Tests against Australia.

India snatched a draw in the rain-blighted third Test in Brisbane despite yet another top order debacle that left them reeling at 74-5 in reply to Australia's 445.

Number seven batter Ravindra Jadeja inspired a spirited rearguard action and India's final pair of Akash Deep and Jasprit Bumrah combined in a 47-run partnership to stave off follow-on.

While India managed to keep the five-Test series level at 1-1 heading into the Boxing day test in Melbourne, the fragility of their top order remains a major concern for the tourists.

In five completed innings so far in the series, only once have India managed an opening stand of more than 12 runs.

The lone exception came in the second innings of the series opener in Perth where Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul forged a 201-run partnership to set up their comprehensive victory.

The poor starts meant on three out of those five occasions, India posted sub-200 scores, including twice in the day-night second Test in Adelaide, which Australia won by 10 wickets.

There is a growing feeling in the camp, though, that the worst is behind them and that batting will be easier in the last two tests in Melbourne and Sydney.

"Whatever happened today, it gave us confidence ahead of Melbourne," India captain Rohit Sharma told reporters on Wednesday.

"We're aware we have to start from scratch, conditions are different there and the ball may not move around so much there like it did here."

Rohit's own struggle with form is symptomatic of the greater malaise afflicting the Indian top order.

The 37-year-old, who missed the opening Test to be with his newborn son in Mumbai, has just one fifty in his last 13 test innings.

The opener has moved down to the middle order in his bid to regain form but managed a highest score of 10 in three innings.

"I have not batted well, there is no harm in accepting that," Rohit said, denying he was feeling under pressure.

"As long as my mind, my body and my feet are moving well, I'm pretty happy with how things are panning out for me."

India need to win both matches to make the World Test Championship (WTC) final for the third time in a row without having to rely on other results.

Champions Australia need two wins and a draw in their next four tests, which include two in Sri Lanka, to be sure of qualification.



Title: Maharaj out of Pakistan ODIs, doubt for crucial Test series

South Africa are top of the World Test Championship table and need victory in one of their two remaining matches against Pakistan

First choice spinner Keshav Maharaj has been ruled out of the remaining two One-Day Internationals against Pakistan and is a doubt for the crucial two-Test home series against the sub-continent side that starts on Dec 26.

Maharaj has a left adductor strain and will miss the 50-over fixtures in Cape Town on Thursday and Johannesburg on Sunday, but of much greater concern will be the 34-year-old’s availability for the Test series.

South Africa are top of the World Test Championship table and need victory in one of their two remaining matches against Pakistan to guarantee a place at the Lord’s final in June next year.

Should Maharaj be unavailable, the only specialist spinner in the Test squad is the less experienced Senuran Muthusamy. Bjorn Fortuin has been named as his replacement for the final two ODIs.



Title: India-Pakistan matches at ICC events to be held at neutral venues

Due to soured relations, India have not visited Pakistan since 2008 and the rivals play each other only at multi-team events

Matches between politically-estranged rivals India and Pakistan at ICC events that either nation is due to host will be played at neutral venues, the International Cricket Council said on Thursday ending uncertainty over next year's Champions Trophy.

The arrangement will apply to two major ICC events next year - the men's Champions Trophy in Pakistan and the women's ODI World Cup in India.

It will also be in place for the men's T20 World Cup in 2026, which India will co-host alongside Sri Lanka, and the women's T20 World Cup in 2028 in Pakistan, the ICC said.

"The match schedule for the men's Champions Trophy 2025 will be confirmed in the coming days," the ICC said in a statement.

Due to soured relations, India have not visited Pakistan since 2008 and the rivals play each other only at multi-team events.

Pakistan visited India for the 50-overs World Cup last year but the Indian cricket board (BCCI) has decided not to send its team to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy next year, citing government advice.

Pakistan also hosted the Asia Cup last year but winners India played all their matches in Sri Lanka under.

The Pakistan Cricket Board initially rejected the idea of adopting that "hybrid model" for the Champions Trophy before accepting it on condition that they would be allowed similar favours for ICC events in India.

A politically charged-up India v Pakistan contest is the most anticipated match in any ICC tournament, especially after the suspension of bilateral tours between the bitter cricket-mad neighbours.

PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi is also Pakistan's Interior Minister, while Jay Shah, who was the BCCI secretary until he took over as ICC chairman earlier this month, is the son of India's Home Minister Amit Shah.



Title: Santner named New Zealand's white ball captain

The left-arm spinner will take charge of the team for the first time in a T20 series against Sri Lanka starting in late December

Left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner was named as the successor to Kane Williamson as New Zealand captain in one-day internationals and Twenty20 cricket on Wednesday.

The 32-year-old, who has played 243 internationals and captained his country in 28 short format matches on a temporary basis, will take charge of the team for the first time in a T20 series against Sri Lanka starting in late December.

"It's obviously a huge honour and a privilege to be asked," said Santner, who was named Player of the Match as New Zealand thrashed England in the third test on Tuesday.

"When you're a young kid the dream was always to play for New Zealand but to have the opportunity to officially lead my country in two formats is special."

Williamson stepped down from the white ball captaincy after the T20 World Cup in the United States and Caribbean earlier this year, having handed the test captaincy over to Tim Southee in 2022.

Southee in turn passed it on to Tom Latham in October and coach Gary Stead said the appointment of Santner would allow the opening batsman to concentrate on that job.

"Tom's doing a great job as full-time test captain since taking over in October and we're keen to allow him to focus on that job which requires a considerable amount of time and energy," he said.

Santner said it was an exciting time to take over the short format teams with many of the generation that took New Zealand to the finals of the 2015 and 2019 ODI World Cups having retired or approaching retirement.

"There's obviously a little bit of a changing of the guard with some of our experienced players at the back end of their careers," he said.

"I think that's exciting for the remainder of the group and the young players to now take on the challenge and drive this team forward to further success."



Title: 'Not beholden to stats': Cummins defends Australia's batters

He says his batters fell quickly on Wednesday while chasing quick runs to allow a declaration that could set up a small chance of victory

Australia captain Pat Cummins has leapt to the defence of his top order batsmen after they again struggled for runs in the drawn third Test against India in Brisbane.

Australia collapsed to 33 for five in their second innings at the Gabba on Wednesday, with the top four all dismissed for single-digit scores before Cummins declared at 79 for eight.

The new opening combination of Usman Khawaja and Nathan McSweeney has failed to build a partnership of more than 21 runs in the series, while number three Marnus Labuschagne is averaging 16.40 from his five innings, despite a half-century in the second Test in Adelaide.

Cummins said his batters fell quickly on Wednesday while chasing quick runs to allow a declaration that could set up a small chance of victory.

"We are not beholden to stats," Cummins told reporters.

"We know there are certain roles and easier times to bat and harder times to bat, just like bowlers.

"You are looking at the best seven batters as a unit to play the best you can."

The series is tied at 1-1 ahead of the fourth test in Melbourne starting Dec 26.

The top order's struggles have coincided with eye-catching scores by 19-year-old talent Sam Konstas, who scored a century against an Indian selection in the tour match in Canberra.

He also became the youngest player to score a half-century in the Big Bash League this week on debut in Australia's domestic T20 competition, making 56 from 27 balls for Sydney Thunder.

Pundits have called on selectors to blood Konstas in the test squad after he missed out on selection in favour of McSweeney, who has been retooled as an opener after playing largely at number three.

Cummins defended McSweeney's lean output while declining to comment on whether selectors would stick with him for the remaining matches in Melbourne and Sydney.

"I have been impressed with the way he has gone about it," said Cummins of McSweeney, who was caught behind for four on Wednesday after making nine in the first innings.

"Today for someone starting out his career he was selfless to go out and try and play his shots rather than preserve (his wicket) and get a score.

"He probably hasn't got the runs he would have liked but he has played important knocks that have set up a win in Adelaide and a good result here."



Title: Sammy appointed West Indies coach across all formats

The former captain has demonstrated exceptional leadership during his tenure with the white-ball teams

West Indies have appointed former captain Daren Sammy as coach across all three formats of the game, handing him control of the test team from next year in addition to the one-day international and Twenty20 sides.

The current Test coach, Andre Coley, will remain in charge for January's series against Pakistan before moving into a high-performance role, Cricket West Indies (CWI) said in a statement.

"Daren Sammy has demonstrated exceptional leadership during his tenure with the white-ball teams," said CWI President Kishore Shallow.

"His vision, dedication, and ability to inspire players make him the ideal candidate to lead across all formats. This appointment marks a bold and exciting step forward as we strive to elevate West Indies cricket to new heights."

Sammy, the first St Lucian to play international cricket, captained West Indies to T20 World Cup triumphs in 2012 and 2016 and took charge of the white-ball teams as coach in May 2023.

He will celebrate his 41st birthday on Friday.

West Indies are currently ranked fourth in the T20 world rankings, eighth in tests and 10th in one-day internationals.

The test team have endured a significant decline in fortunes since they were the most feared side in world cricket for a period from the late 1970s to the early 1990s.

The Caribbean islanders have won three of 15 tests since Coley took charge on an interim basis in December 2022, although that did include a notable victory over Australia in Brisbane earlier this year.

"We recognise and appreciate Andre's efforts during his tenure, and look forward to him serving West Indies cricket in other meaningful capacities," said the CWI's director of cricket Miles Bascombe.

"We are confident that there will be a seamless transition from Andre to Daren for the test (team), both are professionals who have worked productively in the past."



Title: Rohit says India won't rush Shami's return unless '200% sure'

Shami has not played international cricket since the 50-overs World Cup last year because of an ankle injury that needed surgery

India will not rush Mohammed Shami return to international cricket in the last two Tests in Australia unless they are "200% sure" about the seamer's fitness, captain Rohit Sharma said on Wednesday.

Shami has not played international cricket since the 50-overs World Cup last year because of an ankle injury that needed surgery.

The 34-year-old, an automatic choice as India's second seamer when fit, has returned to domestic cricket to prove his fitness.

The lack of support for pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah in Australia has prompted demands for Shami's recall but Rohit was cautious about rushing back the bowler, who reported a knee swelling on his comeback trail.

"I understand he's playing a lot of cricket back home, but there have been some complaints about his knee as well," Rohit said after India snatched a draw in the rain-blighted third test in Brisbane on Wednesday.

"The last thing you want is the player coming here and then pulling out in the middle of the game. You know what happens when that kind of thing happens."

He said he would go by the advice of the medics at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) where Shami did his rehabilitation.

"Unless we are not 100% but 200% sure, we're not going to take any risk... the door is open if those guys at the NCA feel that he is okay to go and recover and play. We'll be happy to have him."

Bumrah is currently the leading wicket-taker in the five-Test series in Australia but Mohammed Siraj has not been equally impressive as his new ball colleague.

India will take heart from third seamer Akash Deep's bowling at the Gabba where the right-arm quick claimed three wickets to go with a defiant 31 that helped India avoid follow-on.



Title: India's 'carrom ball' champion Ashwin bows out of international cricket

His 537 wickets from 106 Tests is the second highest by an Indian bowler behind Anil Kumble's 619

Batters around the world heaved a sigh of relief on Wednesday as Ravichandran Ashwin brought down the curtain on an international career that saw the India spinner take more than 500 Test wickets with an arsenal that included the dreaded 'carrom ball'.

The 38-year-old was not selected for the opening Test against Australia in Perth but returned to the side for the day-night second match in Adelaide, where he took one wicket.

That would prove to be his final test after Ashwin was again left out in Brisbane where India snatched a draw in a rain-blighted contest.

Ashwin's 537 wickets from 106 Tests is the second highest by an Indian bowler behind Anil Kumble's 619. He also played 116 one-dayers and 65 Twenty20 Internationals, finishing with 765 wickets across formats.

"This will be my last day as an Indian cricketer in all formats at the international level," a composed Ashwin told reporters with captain Rohit Sharma by his side.

"I do feel there's a bit of punch left in me as a cricketer, but I would like to express that and probably showcase that in club-level cricket."

Since making his India debut in an ODI against Sri Lanka in 2010, Ashwin went on to fill the void created by the retirement of Kumble.

A cerebral spinner with a fast bowler's aggression, Ashwin grew to become a match-winner on India's turning tracks, where his impeccable control and ability to bowl long spells made him a huge asset.

Obsessed with the small details of his craft, the off-spinner constantly tinkered with his technique in his relentless quest for perfection.

Ashwin bowled leg spin in domestic cricket to expand his repertoire and mastered the 'carrom ball', in which he flicked the ball with knuckle.

He is also an unabashed advocate of 'Mankading', famously running out Jos Buttler after the Englishman had strayed out of the crease at the non-striker's end during an Indian Premier League match.

The Indian was a big influence on his peers, with Australian spinner Nathan Lyon calling him one of his "biggest coaches' in the run-up to the ongoing series for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

Ashwin, who will return home on Thursday, also evolved into a decent Test all-rounder, hitting six hundreds in the format.

India captain Rohit said he convinced Ashwin to stay on for the pink ball Test in Adelaide after learning of the spinner's retirement plans.

While Ashwin's retirement was kept tightly under wraps, the emotional-looking spinner was pictured hugging team mate Virat Kohli in the team changing room during the match on Wednesday.

"I have created a lot of memories alongside Rohit and several of my other teammates, even though I have lost some of them (from the India side) over the last few years," Ashwin said of his contemporaries.

"We're the last bunch of OGs, if we can say that, left out in the dressing room, and I will be marking this as my date of having played at this level."



Title: Australia's Head brushes off fitness query after struggling at Gabba

He earned his second successive Player of the Match award at the Gabba after scoring 152

Australia batsman Travis Head brushed off concerns about his fitness after he struggled to run on day five of the drawn third Test against India on Wednesday, insisting that he will be fit for the next clash in Melbourne.

The middle order batter hobbled when running between wickets and did not take the field during India's brief fourth innings at the Gabba, prompting speculation of a possible quadriceps injury.

"It's just a bit sore. I will be fine," he said when asked about his prospects of playing in the traditional "Boxing Day Test" at the Melbourne Cricket Ground from Dec 26.

Losing Head, the team's most in-form batsman, would be a massive blow for Australia's hopes of winning the five-test series which is level at 1-1.

He earned his second successive Player of the Match award at the Gabba after scoring 152 in Australia's first innings 445, having scored a match-winning hundred in the second Test in Adelaide.

Head also took a wicket at the Gabba with his part-time spin to wrap up India's first innings for 260 in the morning on day five, having tailender Akash Deep stumped for 31.



Title: Bangladesh bowlers topple West Indies to clinch T20 series

Though Bangladesh posted only 129 with the bat, disciplined bowling led the Tigers to a win

A disciplined bowling attack has seen Bangladesh beat the West Indies by 27 runs in the second T20 in Kingstown to win the series.

The hosts won the toss and sent Bangladesh into bat. The runs seemed to come reluctantly as players struggled to find the boundary.

The difference maker was Shamim Hossain, who posted a blazing 35 runs off 17 deliveries with two fours and two sixes at the tail end of the innings. Mehidy Hasan Miraz contributed 26 off 25 balls, while Jaker Ali hit 21 off 20.

But it was Bangladesh’s bowlers who would prove to be the difference. Taskin Ahmed led the line, picking up 3-16, while Rishad Hossain nabbed 2-12, Mahedi Hasan 2-20, and Tanzim Hasan Sakib 2-22.

The West Indies struggled to put up any resistance, with only three batsmen making it to double figures.

However, the Tigers had to weather a scare even after the hosts looked winded at 42-6. Roston Chase (32) and Akeal Hosein (31) played a few cautious overs, getting comfortable at the crease before suddenly exploding with a number of sixes in the final few overs.

Rishad eventually broke through the partnership by bowling out Chase as he attempted to clear the ground once again. He struck once more with the very next delivery to dismiss Gudakesh Motie.

Taskin polished off the innings by taking out Hosein with a clever change of pace in the 19th over.



Title: England captain Stokes not blaming injury on extra bowling load

He will have an MRI scan on the injury on Wednesday

England captain Ben Stokes does not think the heavier bowling workload he undertook in the third Test against New Zealand was a contributory factor to the hamstring injury he suffered during the match.

Stokes, who missed four Tests after tearing the same hamstring during The Hundred in August, played no further part in the match after suffering the injury on Monday.

"Every time you walk out onto a field as an athlete, you're putting yourself at risk of getting injury," the 33-year-old said in Hamilton after England's loss by 423 runs on Tuesday.

"I worked my ass off to get to where I was in this game, in particular, with my body. It's just Sod's law that the first time in a while I feel like I'm young again, something happens."

Stokes bowled 24 overs in New Zealand's first innings and was two balls into his 13th over of the second when he suffered the injury -- a much heavier workload than in the first two Tests.

The all-rounder said he had been extremely emotional after being forced to leave the field and questioned whether there was anything he could have done differently to avoid the injury.

"When you, when you sleep in it and you take the emotion out of it, you realise that when you're walking out there, you're always putting yourself at risk," he added.

"And that's what it is. I worked really hard to get myself into position to play the role that I did this game, and it's just one of those unfortunate things."

Stokes, who will have an MRI scan on the injury on Wednesday, said he would have batted on Tuesday if England had been close to chasing down their monumental target.

England do not play again in the longest format until a one-off test against Zimbabwe in May before a five-match home series against India in July and August.

"With my injury in the summer, straightaway I looked at we've got certain amount of time until the next test series, whereas this one we've got ages till we meet up as a test team again," he said.

"But I can't go into too much detail until we actually know what the extent of the injury is. I certainly hope (I'll be fit to face India), it's not that bad."



Title: Australia frustrated as India avoid follow-on in Gabba Test

Opener KL Rahul and recalled all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja also score brave fifties as India dig deep on another rain-blighted day

Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep mounted a defiant 10th wicket stand to help India avoid the follow-on on day four of the third Test in Brisbane on Tuesday as Australia's slight hopes of victory were further diminished by an injury to Josh Hazlewood.

Opener KL Rahul and recalled all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja also scored brave fifties as India dug deep on another rain-blighted day at the Gabba.

With a gloom falling over the stadium, Deep sent a thick edge off Pat Cummins flying over a leaping fielder at gully for four runs to push India to safety, sparking celebrations among teammates watching in the stands.

Number 11 Deep smashed the Australia captain for six two balls later with a touch of arrogance, then blocked another delivery before stumps were called due to failing light.

Deep was unbeaten on 27, with Bumrah on 10, the tailenders having pushed India to 252 for nine, still 193 runs behind Australia's first innings 445.

Their unbroken 39-run partnership has all but saved India from defeat and a 2-1 deficit in the five-Test series, with Australia forced to bat again and left with little time to take another 10 wickets.

The hosts' task has been made tougher with a calf injury to fast bowler Hazlewood, who has been ruled out of the remainder of the Test and is expected to miss the rest of the five-match series.

"It was not just the runs they got but the heart they showed. It will give us as a group a lot of confidence," Rahul said of the Deep-Bumrah rearguard.

"When it mattered they played some very exciting shots.

"It is really good to see that they could get that partnership and avoid the follow-on.

"It makes a huge difference knowing that there is a bit of rain around. We needed to find a way to stay in the game. Bumrah and Akash did that. It was a good way to end the day for us."

India had resumed on 201 for seven after tea, still 45 runs short of avoiding the follow-on.

It looked bleak for them when Jadeja holed out with a pull-shot off Cummins to fall for 77, with Mitchell Marsh bolting in from deep square leg to take a fine, low catch.

Mitchell Starc had earlier done for Mohammed Siraj, the number nine caught behind for one.

But with Hazlewood out of commission and spinner Nathan Lyon ineffective, a fatigued Starc and Cummins were unable to grab the last wicket.

STUNNING CATCH

Rain breaks continuously sapped Australia's momentum but Cummins found time to take the wicket of Nitish Kumar Reddy for 16 before tea when the all-rounder chopped onto his stumps.

That broke a patient 53-run stand with Jadeja, who was crucial to India avoiding the follow-on.

As was Rahul.

Steve Smith dropped Rahul on 33 with the first ball of the morning when Cummins had the opener edge to the slips.

Rahul went on to score 84 before Smith redeemed himself with a stunning catch at slip to deny him a century, leaping to his right to pluck a one-hander off Lyon's bowling.

Though Australia have dominated the rain-hit Test, time will most likely deny the hosts.

Whichever way the match goes, India captain Rohit Sharma will face more scrutiny after another failure with the bat.

He was caught behind for 10 in the morning, nicking fast bowler Cummins with a lead-footed drive after being softened up by a bouncer from the Australian skipper.

Rohit has 19 runs from his three innings in the series, having missed India's victory in Perth while caring for his newborn son.

Australia batsman Travis Head brushed off concerns about his fitness after he struggled to run on day five of the drawn third Test against India on Wednesday, insisting that he will be fit for the next clash in Melbourne.

The middle order batter hobbled when running between wickets and did not take the field during India's brief fourth innings at the Gabba, prompting speculation of a possible quadriceps injury.

"It's just a bit sore. I will be fine," he said when asked about his prospects of playing in the traditional "Boxing Day Test" at the Melbourne Cricket Ground from Dec 26.

Losing Head, the team's most in-form batsman, would be a massive blow for Australia's hopes of winning the five-test series which is level at 1-1.

He earned his second successive Player of the Match award at the Gabba after scoring 152 in Australia's first innings 445, having scored a match-winning hundred in the second Test in Adelaide.

Head also took a wicket at the Gabba with his part-time spin to wrap up India's first innings for 260 in the morning on day five, having tailender Akash Deep stumped for 31.



Title: India's 'carrom ball' champion Ashwin bows out of international cricket

His 537 wickets from 106 Tests is the second highest by an Indian bowler behind Anil Kumble's 619

Batters around the world heaved a sigh of relief on Wednesday as Ravichandran Ashwin brought down the curtain on an international career that saw the India spinner take more than 500 Test wickets with an arsenal that included the dreaded 'carrom ball'.

The 38-year-old was not selected for the opening Test against Australia in Perth but returned to the side for the day-night second match in Adelaide, where he took one wicket.

That would prove to be his final test after Ashwin was again left out in Brisbane where India snatched a draw in a rain-blighted contest.

Ashwin's 537 wickets from 106 Tests is the second highest by an Indian bowler behind Anil Kumble's 619. He also played 116 one-dayers and 65 Twenty20 Internationals, finishing with 765 wickets across formats.

"This will be my last day as an Indian cricketer in all formats at the international level," a composed Ashwin told reporters with captain Rohit Sharma by his side.

"I do feel there's a bit of punch left in me as a cricketer, but I would like to express that and probably showcase that in club-level cricket."

Since making his India debut in an ODI against Sri Lanka in 2010, Ashwin went on to fill the void created by the retirement of Kumble.

A cerebral spinner with a fast bowler's aggression, Ashwin grew to become a match-winner on India's turning tracks, where his impeccable control and ability to bowl long spells made him a huge asset.

Obsessed with the small details of his craft, the off-spinner constantly tinkered with his technique in his relentless quest for perfection.

Ashwin bowled leg spin in domestic cricket to expand his repertoire and mastered the 'carrom ball', in which he flicked the ball with knuckle.

He is also an unabashed advocate of 'Mankading', famously running out Jos Buttler after the Englishman had strayed out of the crease at the non-striker's end during an Indian Premier League match.

The Indian was a big influence on his peers, with Australian spinner Nathan Lyon calling him one of his "biggest coaches' in the run-up to the ongoing series for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

Ashwin, who will return home on Thursday, also evolved into a decent Test all-rounder, hitting six hundreds in the format.

India captain Rohit said he convinced Ashwin to stay on for the pink ball Test in Adelaide after learning of the spinner's retirement plans.

While Ashwin's retirement was kept tightly under wraps, the emotional-looking spinner was pictured hugging team mate Virat Kohli in the team changing room during the match on Wednesday.

"I have created a lot of memories alongside Rohit and several of my other teammates, even though I have lost some of them (from the India side) over the last few years," Ashwin said of his contemporaries.

"We're the last bunch of OGs, if we can say that, left out in the dressing room, and I will be marking this as my date of having played at this level."



Title: Rohit says India won't rush Shami's return unless '200% sure'

Shami has not played international cricket since the 50-overs World Cup last year because of an ankle injury that needed surgery

India will not rush Mohammed Shami return to international cricket in the last two Tests in Australia unless they are "200% sure" about the seamer's fitness, captain Rohit Sharma said on Wednesday.

Shami has not played international cricket since the 50-overs World Cup last year because of an ankle injury that needed surgery.

The 34-year-old, an automatic choice as India's second seamer when fit, has returned to domestic cricket to prove his fitness.

The lack of support for pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah in Australia has prompted demands for Shami's recall but Rohit was cautious about rushing back the bowler, who reported a knee swelling on his comeback trail.

"I understand he's playing a lot of cricket back home, but there have been some complaints about his knee as well," Rohit said after India snatched a draw in the rain-blighted third test in Brisbane on Wednesday.

"The last thing you want is the player coming here and then pulling out in the middle of the game. You know what happens when that kind of thing happens."

He said he would go by the advice of the medics at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) where Shami did his rehabilitation.

"Unless we are not 100% but 200% sure, we're not going to take any risk... the door is open if those guys at the NCA feel that he is okay to go and recover and play. We'll be happy to have him."

Bumrah is currently the leading wicket-taker in the five-Test series in Australia but Mohammed Siraj has not been equally impressive as his new ball colleague.

India will take heart from third seamer Akash Deep's bowling at the Gabba where the right-arm quick claimed three wickets to go with a defiant 31 that helped India avoid follow-on.



Title: Mayotte cyclone kills several hundred, maybe thousands, in worst storm in century

Cyclone Chido hit Mayotte overnight, Meteo-France said, with winds of more than 200 kph (124 mph), damaging housing, government buildings and a hospital

Several hundred people and possibly even thousands may have been killed when the most powerful cyclone in nearly a century hit the French Indian Ocean archipelago of Mayotte, a senior local French official said on Sunday.

"I think there will certainly be several hundreds, maybe we will reach a thousand, even several thousands," prefect Francois-Xavier Bieuville said on local media channel Mayotte La 1ere.

Asked about the death toll from Cyclone Chido, the French interior ministry said "it will be difficult to account for all victims" and a figure could not be determined at this stage.

Cyclone Chido hit Mayotte overnight, Meteo-France said, with winds of more than 200 kph (124 mph), damaging housing, government buildings and a hospital. It was the strongest storm in more than 90 years to hit the islands, the forecaster said.

"Honestly, what we are experiencing is a tragedy, you feel like you are in the aftermath of a nuclear war… I saw an entire neighborhood disappear," Mohamed Ishmael, a resident of Mayotte's capital Mamoudzou, told Reuters by phone.

Aerial footage shared by the French gendarmerie showed the wreckage of hundreds of makeshift houses strewn across the hills of one of Mayotte's islands, which have been a focal point for illegal immigration from nearby Comoros.

Local media images showed a mother pushing a newborn baby's crib along the flooded corridor of Mayotte's hospital. Capsized police boats lay onshore while coconut trees had crashed through the roofs of many buildings.

"My thoughts are with our compatriots in Mayotte, who have gone through the most horrific few hours, and who have, for some, lost everything, lost their lives," French President Emmanuel Macron said.

In the last few decades thousands of people have attempted to make the crossing from Comoros, off the coast of East Africa, to Mayotte, which has a higher standard of living and access to the French welfare system.

Over 100,000 undocumented migrants live in Mayotte, according to the French interior ministry.

It was difficult to ascertain the precise death toll after the cyclone, which also raised concerns about access to food, water and sanitation, authorities said.

"For the toll, it's going to be complicated, because Mayotte is a Muslim land where the dead are buried within 24 hours," a French interior ministry official said earlier.

Located nearly 8,000 km (5,000 miles) from Paris, Mayotte is significantly poorer than the rest of France and has grappled with gang violence and social unrest for decades.

More than three-quarters of the people in Mayotte live below the French poverty line. Tensions were stoked earlier this year by a water shortage.

An air bridge was being put in place from Reunion island, another French overseas territory on the other side of Madagascar, the government said.

The disaster is the first challenge faced by Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, days after he was named by Macron following the collapse of the previous government.

The cyclone went on to hit northern Mozambique on Sunday, but the full extent of the impact was not clear. Internet monitor NetBlocks said on X that heavy rain and winds had damaged power and telecommunications infrastructure.

In Comoros, two people were slightly injured, 24 displaced, and 21 homes were destroyed, authorities said.

France colonised Mayotte in 1843 and annexed the whole archipelago, including Comoros, in 1904.

In a 1974 referendum, 95% backed separation but 63% on Mayotte voted to stay French. Grande Comore, Anjouan and Moheli declared independence in 1975. Mayotte is still ruled from Paris.



Title: Monarch butterfly may gain threatened species status in US

Environmental groups have been pushing for US protection of the winged pollinators for a decade

The US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed listing the monarch butterfly as a threatened species on Tuesday, citing a significant decline in the iconic black and orange insects that has pushed them toward extinction.

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

Monarch butterflies, known for migrating thousands of miles (km) across North America, have experienced a decades-long U.S. population decline due to habitat loss caused by human activities such as farming and urban development, widespread use of pesticides and climate change.

Environmental groups have been pushing for US protection of the winged pollinators for a decade.

KEY QUOTE

"The iconic monarch butterfly is cherished across North America, captivating children and adults throughout its fascinating lifecycle," US FWS Director Martha Williams said in a statement.

"Despite its fragility, it is remarkably resilient, like many things in nature when we just give them a chance. Science shows that the monarch needs that chance, and this proposed listing invites and builds on unprecedented public participation in shaping monarch conservation efforts," she added

CONTEXT

Despite being recognised as needing federal protection under the Endangered Species Act four years ago, the monarch butterfly waited behind dozens of other species facing more immediate threats.

The ESA, signed into law in 1973, is credited with helping to save the bald eagle, California condor and numerous other animals and plants from extinction. ESA protection makes it illegal to kill or harm species classified as threatened or endangered without a special permit.

BY THE NUMBERS

The eastern migratory monarch population has declined by about 80% since the 1980s, while the western migratory population has dropped by more than 95%. The declines put the western populations at greater than 99% chance of extinction by 2080, according to the FWS.

The agency is proposing to designate 4,395 acres (1,780 hectares) in California as "critical habitat" for the butterflies. Federal agencies are prohibited from destroying or modifying areas with that designation.

WHAT'S NEXT

The public will have until March 12, 2025 to comment on the proposal to list the monarch butterfly. The service will then evaluate the comments and any additional information on the species to determine whether to list the monarch butterfly.



Title: Govt advises people with health issues to stay indoors as air pollution rises

Environment ministry urges mask use for those venturing outside amid alarming air quality

The air quality in Dhaka and its surrounding areas has fluctuated between "unhealthy" and "hazardous," prompting the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change to advise individuals at risk to avoid going outside unless necessary.

The ministry recommended using masks for anyone needing to step outdoors in these conditions in a statement on Tuesday.

Citizens were also urged to monitor the environment department’s website for regular updates and take appropriate precautions.

Data from international air quality monitoring platform IQAir showed that Dhaka’s Air Quality Index, or AQI, stood at 193 at 6pm on Tuesday, categorised as "unhealthy."

At that time, Dhaka ranked second among cities with the worst air quality globally.

The AQI worsened after 10pm, remaining above 200—sometimes even exceeding 300—through to the following afternoon.

Air quality levels depend on the concentration of fine particulate matter, such as PM10 and PM2.5, measured in micrograms per cubic metre.

Other pollutants like sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ground-level ozone also contribute to the AQI.

An AQI score of 51-100 is considered "moderate" or "acceptable."

Scores between 101-150 are "unhealthy for sensitive groups."

Scores between 151-200 indicate "unhealthy" air.

Scores of 201-300 represent "very unhealthy" conditions.

Anything above 300 is deemed "hazardous" or "disastrous."

According to the environment department’s AQI data, Dhaka's air quality has mostly remained above 150 since Oct 12, except for 12 days when it dropped below this level.

During this 59-day period, the AQI exceeded 200 on 13 days.

Last Thursday, Dhaka's AQI hit 335.

To combat air pollution, the environment ministry has issued directives to halt the burning of solid waste, install covers and enclosures at construction sites, transport construction materials under covers, spray water at least twice daily around such sites, and bar the use of old or smoke-producing vehicles on the roads.

Brick kiln operators, factory owners, and the public have also been urged to comply with these measures.

The ministry emphasised that tackling air pollution requires collaborative efforts from the government and citizens.



Title: Extreme heat puts garment factory workers at risk, study shows

The study report urged retailers and brands to invest in higher wages and health protections so that workers can manage the risk of missing work days due to heatwaves

Workers in some of the world's biggest garment manufacturing hubs in Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Pakistan are increasingly exposed to extreme heat as climate change pushes temperatures up, a report found on Sunday, a problem multinational retailers and brands will have to help address.

New European Union regulations make retailers selling in the bloc, like Inditex, H&M and Nike, legally liable for conditions at their suppliers, putting pressure on them to help fund improvements to cool factories they source from.

In Dhaka, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Phnom Penh and Karachi, the number of days with "wet-bulb" temperatures - a measurement that accounts for air temperature as well as humidity - above 30.5 degrees Celsius jumped by 42% in 2020-2024 compared to 2005-2009, researchers at Cornell University's Global Labor Institute found.

Above that threshold, the International Labor Organisation recommends as much rest as work in any given hour to maintain safe core body temperature levels.

The report identified only three retailers - Nike, Levi's, and VF Corp - which specifically include protocols to protect workers from heat exhaustion in their supplier codes of conduct.

COMPANIES WARNED

"We've been talking to brands for ages now about this issue, and they're only now starting to turn their attention to it," Jason Judd, executive director at Cornell University's Global Labor Institute, told Reuters.

"If a brand or retailer knows that temperatures in a production area are excessively high or doing damage to worker health, then they're obligated under this new set of rules to do something about it," he added.

The EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive came into force in July and will start applying to large companies from mid-2027.

Fixes to cool factories could include better ventilation and water evaporative cooling systems, instead of energy-intensive and expensive air conditioning that would increase manufacturers' carbon emissions.

Some factory owners would likely be willing to make such investments themselves, given how heat stress significantly impacts productivity, Judd said, but the EU rules highlight brands' responsibility to address the issue too.

The report also urged retailers and brands to invest in higher wages and health protections so that workers can manage the risk of missing work days due to heatwaves.

Extreme heat and flooding could erase $65 billion in apparel export earnings from Bangladesh, Cambodia, Pakistan and Vietnam by 2030, research from asset manager Schroders and the Global Labor Institute found last year.



Title: 2024 will be the hottest year on record, EU scientists say

The data comes two weeks after a $300bn deal to tackle climate change, a package poorer countries blasted as insufficient

This year will be the world's warmest since records began, with extraordinarily high temperatures expected to persist into at least the first few months of 2025, European Union scientists said on Monday.

The data from the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) comes two weeks after UN climate talks yielded a $300-billion deal to tackle climate change, a package poorer countries blasted as insufficient to cover the soaring cost of climate-related disasters.

C3S said data from January to November had confirmed 2024 is now certain to be the hottest year on record, and the first in which average global temperatures exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period.

The previous hottest year on record was 2023.

Extreme weather has swept around the world in 2024, with severe drought hitting Italy and South America, fatal floods in Nepal, Sudan and Europe, heatwaves in Mexico, Mali and Saudi Arabia that killed thousands, and disastrous cyclones in the US and the Philippines.

Scientific studies have confirmed the fingerprints of human-caused climate change on all of these disasters.

Last month ranked as the second-warmest November on record after November 2023.

"We're still in near-record-high territory for global temperatures, and that's likely to stay at least for the next few months," Copernicus climate researcher Julien Nicolas told Reuters.

Carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels are the main cause of climate change.

Cutting emissions to net zero - as many governments have pledged to eventually do - will stop global warming from getting worse. Yet despite these green pledges, global CO2 emissions are set to hit a record high this year.

Scientists are also monitoring whether the La Nina weather pattern - which involves the cooling of ocean surface temperatures - could form in 2025.

That could briefly cool global temperatures, though it would not halt the long-term underlying trend of warming caused by emissions. The world is currently in neutral conditions, after El Nino - La Nina's hotter counterpart - ended earlier this year.

"While 2025 might be slightly cooler than 2024, if a La Nina event develops, this does not mean temperatures will be 'safe' or 'normal'," said Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer at Imperial College London.

"We will still experience high temperatures, resulting in dangerous heatwaves, droughts, wildfires and tropical cyclones."

C3S' records go back to 1940, and are cross-checked with global temperature records going back to 1850.



Title: World Court to open climate change hearings

While the court's advisory opinions are not binding, they are legally and politically significant

The United Nations' top court on Monday starts hearings on the legal obligation of countries to fight climate change and the consequences for states of contributing to global warming, the outcome of which could influence litigation worldwide.

Vanuatu, one of the small island states that spearheaded the effort to get the International Court of Justice to give a so-called advisory opinion, will be the first of over a hundred states and international organisations to give their views in two weeks of proceedings starting at 10am (0900 GMT).

While the court's advisory opinions are not binding, they are legally and politically significant. Experts say the court's eventual opinion on climate change will likely be cited in climate change-driven lawsuits in courts from Europe to Latin America and beyond.

The hearings begin a week after developing nations denounced as woefully inadequate an agreement reached at the COP29 summit for countries to provide $300 billion in annual climate finance by 2035 to help poorer nations cope with climate change.

Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu's special envoy for climate change and the environment, said it was imperative fossil fuels be phased out and more money provided to poorer nations bearing the brunt of climate change, such as his Pacific island nation.

"We would like cumulative historical emissions that cause significant harm to the climate system to be declared unlawful," Regenvanu told Reuters.

Aside from small island states and numerous Western and developing countries, the court will also hear from the world's top two emitters of greenhouse gases, the United States and China. Oil producer group OPEC will also give its views.

The hearings will run until Dec 13. The court's opinion is expected to be delivered in 2025.
