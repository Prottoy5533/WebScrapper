Title: Data analysis in school

Schools must embrace data analysis

We live in a world overflowing with data. From tracking the steps we walk each day to global movements shaping economies, data is everywhere. It tells us stories, reveals patterns, and informs decisions. Yet, despite its ubiquity, our schools haven’t embraced teaching data analysis to children. Why is this essential skill—arguably as important as reading and arithmetic—not a core part of the curriculum?

The question is perplexing, especially when you consider that much of basic data analysis is no more complex than connecting dots or Colouring by numbers—things even young kids can enjoy and understand.

THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE OF DATA

Think about it: data analysis is essentially storytelling with numbers. Consider a simple bar chart comparing how many apples versus oranges are eaten during lunch breaks. The tallest bar? That’s the plot twist—"Kids love apples more!" It’s intuitive, visual, and fun.

Kids naturally engage with data without even realising it. They might count how many stickers they have or compare their scores on a game leaderboard. These are foundational skills for understanding data, but schools rarely connect these everyday experiences to structured learning.

PRIMARY DATA ANALYSIS: A SKILL FOR ALL AGES

Children encounter data daily—they just don’t call it "data." Take a classroom survey: What’s everyone’s favourite animal? Compile the answers, tally them up, and create a chart. Voilà, we’ve just done data analysis!

Here’s a simple example kids could explore:

These are moments of discovery, and they’re magical because they’re powered by curiosity.

Even something as mundane as tracking weekly weather—"How many sunny days versus rainy ones?"—teaches kids to observe, record, and analyse. Data isn’t distant or abstract; it’s happening all around them.

THE BENEFITS OF INTRODUCING DATA ANALYSIS EARLY

Teaching data analysis early does more than build technical skills. It shapes how kids think and interact with the world.

Imagine a child using these skills to plan the best day for a school picnic by analysing sunny versus rainy days. They aren’t just playing; they’re becoming problem-solvers.

CHALLENGES IN THE CURRENT EDUCATION SYSTEM

If data analysis is so simple and valuable, why isn’t it taught widely? The reasons are surprisingly systemic:

This leaves children underprepared for a world where data literacy is essential for even the most basic decisions.

COUNTERARGUMENT: IT’S EASIER THAN IT SEEMS

Critics might argue, “Isn’t data analysis too complicated for kids?” The answer is a resounding no.

The simplest data analysis involves three basic steps:

Interactive tools like Google Sheets or educational apps make these steps engaging and accessible. A child can create their first pie chart within minutes—and feel like a scientist in the making.

GLOBAL TRENDS: WHO’S GETTING IT RIGHT?

Some schools and countries are already reaping the benefits of integrating data literacy into classrooms.

In these classrooms, data isn’t just a subject—it’s a tool to explore the world.

What if we could reimagine how data is taught?

Instead of isolating it as a niche subject, let’s integrate it into everyday lessons:

Science: Measure plant growth rates and chart them over weeks.

Social Studies: Compare population statistics across countries using bar graphs.

Maths: Teach fractions using pie charts of classroom survey results.

Project-based learning could make data analysis a fun, collaborative adventure.

It’s time to stop treating data literacy as an optional skill and start recognizing it as foundational for the 21st century. Parents, teachers, and policymakers must advocate for change. Imagine a generation of children who can confidently decode the world around them through data.

PLANTING THE SEEDS OF DATA LITERACY

The journey towards incorporating data analysis in schools does not have to be daunting. By starting simple and connecting concepts to everyday experiences, we can equip children with the tools they need to thrive in a data-driven future.

It’s not just about numbers; it’s about empowering kids to see, understand, and shape the stories behind them. And what better way to prepare the next generation for tomorrow’s challenges than by planting these seeds today?

Title: Reforming the Constitution

A balance of power is needed in the constitution

Governance system of Bangladesh is a Westminster type Parliamentary form of government. In this system Parliament is to play a major role in governing the country. All decisions of the state are taken in parliament after thorough scrutiny by representatives, elected by the people. All actions of the government are to be made accountable to the Parliament.

In Bangladesh the Constitution and Rules of Procedure of Parliament were initially drafted almost in line with the same. But, in that also Prime Minister (PM) or the Chief Executive of the government was given an overriding power to have absolute control over Parliament. This has been done through inducting an article in the constitution (Article 70). This provision denied party members elected by people, known as Member of Parliament (MP), the right to differ with the party decision or whipping, during voting in parliament. That provides the PM guaranteed support of MPs of the party in decision making process. The government is formed by a majority of votes of MPs in Parliament. All other decisions of the Parliament are also based generally on simple majority votes, excepting amendments of the constitution, which needs two third majority. So, PM has the leverage of taking any decision unilaterally and getting it passed in Parliament.

There could have been some checks and balance in the absolute control of Parliament by PM in case Party Chief, of the government party (CGP) and the PM elect would have been two different persons. Traditionally it never happened. So far, the party chief (CGP) always takes up the position of PM, whenever opportunity comes.

In that context, The first recommendation for reform of the Constitution is, Chief of Government Party (CGP) and Prime Minister (PM) should not be the same person.

Political Party as defined in the constitution

Another scope of creating a balance of power may emerge in case of a hung parliament where no party gets a majority. In that case a coalition government with participation of more than one party is formed. But that can be a rare coincidence. No system should be developed based on chance.

The logic behind inclusion of Article 70 in the constitution was to provide stability to a government. It is argued that socio-economic situation in Bangladesh is not like United Kingdom (UK). In Bangladesh most of the MPs do not have sound financial or educational background. As such, they may not be able to hold high ethical standards needed to refrain themselves from the greed for money or power. Horse treading of MPs, which means taking them in support or against any resolution while voting in Parliament, is assumed possible, by giving bribe either in terms of money or lucrative position in government whatever suits the situation. That can make the functioning of the government very difficult. Also, the government remains vulnerable all the time as it may lose its majority in Parliament at any moment. Nobody can deny that the above consequences are quite possible in Bangladesh. Many countries having similar situations developed a compromise between total rigidity and complete flexibility.

We would like to propose that MPs should be allowed to cross the floor, meaning that they be allowed to vote against the party decision or whipping (as is called officially) only whenever there is split in the party on any issue and split faction become at least one third in number of total MPs of that party.

Article 70 of the constitution

This article should be amended accordingly. It will make horse treading a bit difficult and Parliament could be more functional. For the above suggestion on anti-defection, “Tenth Schedule, Paragraph 3. Of the constitution of India” has been followed.

Experience in history shows, in case one person holds the topmost position for a considerably long period of time that person tends to centralise power and becomes autocratic. As such, the constitution of many countries of the world restricts holding the top office by any person to a maximum of two.

We like to suggest that no Head of Government (PM) can hold the office for more than two terms. This provision can be included in our reformed constitution.

Before going to further reform proposals, we would like to suggest that the Fifteenth Amendment of the constitution should be repealed.

This amendment introduced some provisions which were found not suitable, like elections to be held under the existing government. It has restricted many of the fundamental rights of people by imposing anti-people conditionalities and thereby increasing the control of the government. It also made unamendable almost a third of the constitution which is irrational.

On repeal of the Fifteenth Amendment, the provisions for forming Caretaker Government (CG) for conducting elections would be reintroduced.

The caretaker Government needs to be restored. Chief Adviser better not to be from judiciary as it hinders the independence and neutrality of the judiciary and could become an undesirable example of mixing of judiciary into politics and executive.

In case the President can be made a consensus candidate as is proposed by electing with three fourth majority votes in the parliament, President could head the caretaker government. Art.58B, after repeal of 15th amendment can be altered accordingly.

Repeal of the Fifteenth Amendment will also exclude art. 7A, which is not considered rational under the existing circumstances, and 7B, which binds the hands of future parliament and made almost one third of the constitution unamendable.

Repeal of the Fifteenth Amendment will also make free the freedom of association as per art. 38 from the anti-people restrictive conditions imposed to achieve a more grip of government on fundamental rights.

In support of repeal logic is, no present Parliament can restrict the authority of any future Parliament which has been done with the 15th amendment. Moreover, this amendment was passed by only an absolute or two third majority. Before the 15th amendment, there was a provision for a referendum too for acceptance. That step was by passed. This is a procedural mistake. Those could be strong ground for repeal of the said amendment.

As per our present constitution, President play only ceremonial role. His appointment and removal in most cases are at the mercy of PM. He needs to work as per the dictates of the PM almost in all matters. Whatever independence he has been allowed as per the constitution is useless as his position is too vulnerable to stand beyond the desire of the PM. The urge now is to amend constitution to strike a golden means to achieve effective balance and sharing of constitutional powers between Prime Minister and President.

Under present constitution President can be elected by a simple majority and can be impeached only by two third majority. Election of president as well as impeachment if the government party has two third majority vest in the whim of Prime Minister. We, propose President be elected by three fourth majority and can be impeached only by three fourth majority of member of parliament. This will include a wider role of Parliament in electing President and will ensure empowerment and stability of president as impeachment will be more difficult.

The Presidential Election and other things

Appointment of President should be not on a simple majority but with three fourth majority vote of the Parliament Members. That would allow a consensus candidate to become the President. Art.48A is to be amended to include three fourth majority votes for appointment of President.

Impeachment of President should also be made difficult to lessen his vulnerability by introducing the provision for three fourth majority vote of Parliament for that. Art. 52 of the constitution is to be amended accordingly.

The root crisis of power sharing between President and Prime Minister is article 48 (3) where except 2 (two) powers, i.e., appointment of Prime Minister and appointment of Chief Justice, all other functions, President must do on advice of Prime Minister.

We would like to propose amendment of the said art. 48(3). This should be “In the exercise of all his functions, like appointing the Prime Minister pursuant to clause (3) of article 56 and the Chief justice pursuant to clause (1) of article 95 and any other act as prescribed in the constitution, the President shall act in accordance with the laid procedure if any, or on his own judgement, in case no such procedures exist. “

There should be provision for two deputy speakers one must be nominated/selected from opposition. Art.74 (1) should be amended to include those two deputy speakers to be appointed one each from Government party and opposition.

The 16th amendment restoring 1972 original provision of impeachment of judges of Supreme Court by Parliament has already been nullified by Appellate Division and "Supreme Judicial Council" can be formed for removal of Supreme Court Judges and Election Commissioners. It is proposed that the same “Supreme Judicial Council’ be utilized for removal of members of all other constructional bodies,

There shall be a self-sufficient "Supreme Court Secretariat" to assist the supreme court to administer the functions as vested under Art.109 of the constitution. The same secretariat should also handle the functions of the Supreme Court. The arrangement needs to be included in the constitution.

Article116 of the constitution is contradictory to Article 109 and as such may be considered superfluous and be omitted. As regards appointment of judges of the Supreme Court, Art.95 (2) (c) calls for making a law on the issue.

We propose the law for appointment of Judges of the Supreme Court as Article 95 (2) (c) should include a panel of senior supreme court judges selected by Chief Justice (CJ)to work as a search committee for forwarding recommendations to Chief Justice. The CJ should then pass on the same to the President for finalizing the appointment with his (CJ’s) recommendation.

In respect of reserve seats for women in the Parliament, Art. 65. (3) of the constitution provides provision for fifty (50) seats to be filled exclusively by female candidates through proportional representation voting system through single transferable vote.

Keeping Art 65 (3), that is ‘keeping provisions for fifty (50) seats reserved for women to be filled exclusively by female candidates through proportional representation voting system intact’, we would like to propose, every political party contesting the election must ensure filing of nominations and have valid women candidates for at least ten percent (10%) of total candidates from that party. These women candidates will contest the election along with male candidates of other parties. While selecting candidates against seats exclusively reserved for women, those female candidates of the party who fought direct election but failed to win are to be given priority. This provision should be incorporated in the constitution.

The above arrangement would exert pressure on the political parties to allow more women candidates for direct election with party nomination. At the same time, it would provide scope and incentive to women candidates for contesting direct election against normal seats. Hopefully, this arrangement will gradually reduce the necessity of reserved seats exclusively for women.

President should be allowed to appoint election commissioners without advice of Prime Minister. A "search committee" should be formed by the President to prepare a Panel for EC members. In the search committee one third of the members must be nominated from the opposition.

Election Commission (EC) must have full control over the Civil and Police administration during election and there must be 'default consequence’ i.e., if any public servant does not comply with EC command EC will have own authority to suspend, transfer, dismiss, convict the perpetrator. All service rules must incorporate it.

Article126 of the constitution must incorporate that if any official does not obey the directives of EC during election, it shall have the authority to take appropriate action as deemed fit.

Comptroller and auditor general, Public Service Commission must be appointed by a selection process independent from Prime Minister.

A ‘high-profile Committee’ can be formed by the President consisting of representatives, (1) from judiciary, Supreme Court Judges, (retired or serving) two, (2) from parliament, MPs two (one from government party and another from opposition), (3) from bureaucracy (retired government official) one, (4) from civil society, two. Total of seven (7).

The above body may be given the responsibility to finalise the nominations of candidates and forward that to the President with their recommendation.

The said appointment process that “ a high-profile committee can be formed by the President consisting of representatives , (1) from judiciary, Supreme Court Judges, (retired or serving) two, from parliament , MPs two (one from government party another from opposition) , (3) from bureaucracy (retired government official) one, (4) from civil society, two. Total seven (7), “ may be followed for all the other constitutional bodies, like, Anti-corruption Commission, Human Rights Commission, Right to Information Commission, etc.

In addition to the above we have a few more proposals for reforms to make the Standing Committees of Parliament more effective, and proposals on budget approval process. But that would require amendment of ‘Rules of Procedure of Parliament.’ For that we do not think this is the proper forum to raise those issues. The attention now is on the constitution and the proposal for reform on that.

In the above we forwarded our views and suggestions on what should be done now to the constitution to make it more pro-people and to lessen the centralized control of a single person, PM. Our proposals aim at making parliament flexible enough to act free from absolute control of the PM.

Also, we tried to make a power sharing arrangement between the President and the Prime Minister. This we did to strike a balance of state authority between the President and PM and thereby avoiding a situation where one person, the PM holds the sole authority on all the state functionaries, and thereby possess the scope of becoming an authoritarian ruler or autocrat.

Title: Remembering the Role of Indian Students in 1971

Thousands of Indian students worked among Bangladeshi refugees in 1971

.

Julian Francis

Over the last few months much has been written of the amazing role of students and other young people in the remarkable ‘Monsoon Revolution’ of July and August 2024. It reminds me of the outstanding contribution made by Indian students when they worked among the millions of Bangladeshi refugees who had fled to India as a result of the brutal crackdown by the Pakistani armed forces and their local collaborators.

In 1971, I was responsible for the administration and coordination of OXFAM’s refugee relief programme which covered the supplementary needs-medical, sanitation, specialized feeding, clothing, blankets etc.- of about 600,000 refugees, men, women and children in over 50 refugee camps in Tripura, Meghalaya, Assam, Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri, West Dinajpur, Bongaon and Barasat. At the beginning of the refugee relief work, OXFAM was of the opinion that it would be sensible and more cost effective if local personnel could be recruited rather than flying in many foreigners to assist in the relief work. For the previous 3 years, I had been working for OXFAM in Bihar, India, in a village development programme based at four Gandhian Ashrams. Through our Gandhian connections, we came to know that the daughter of a Gandhian leader, Narayan Desai, was studying for her MBBS at the Nil Ratan Sarkar (NRS) Medical College in Kolkata. One evening in May 1971, we met Sanghamaitra Desai, in the students’ canteen of NRS when we discussed the possibility of medical students being allowed to work on rotation in some of the refugee camps.

Sanghamaitra, known to us as ‘Uma’ and her student colleagues were able to obtain permission for students to work in the OXFAM supported camps on rotation. Later on students came from three other Kolkata medical colleges to work with OXFAM. The days were very long for the passionate young medical students. They would get up at about 4 a.m. to prepare snacks, sandwiches and bottles of drinking water for the day as well as all the necessary medical supplies needed for the day. They were then able to set out for the refugee camps soon after 6 a.m. every day. They would return after dark each day and then plan and prepare for the next day. After the Kolkata University authorities understood the value of the work being undertaken by the medical students, their work in the refugee camps was officially regarded as the practical social and preventive medicine part of the students’ MBBS. The success of OXFAM’s initiative with the young students became well-known and we received monthly batches of students and doctors of some of the Mumbai Medical Colleges. Students also came from Cuttack Medical College, Odisha and the Christian Medical College, Ludhiana, Punjab.

Young doctors were also sent to work with us from the Gujarat branch of the Indian Red Cross. In addition to the medical students involved in the relief work, volunteers came to assist with sanitation and feeding work as well as for assisting the setting up of impromptu schools in the camps. They came in batches from the Gandhi Smarak Nidhi, Orissa, as well as Gandhi Ashram Veddchi and Lok Bharti, Sanosra, Bhavnagar, both in Gujarat. Students also came from Vidya Bhavan, Udaipur, Rajasthan. At the end of November 1971, an editorial in The Statesman newspaper acknowledged the contribution of the students in an editorial entitled, “Serve While You Learn”. The editorial reads: “The commendable enthusiasm with which thousands of medical students from Kashmir to Kerala have responded to the needs of East Bengal refugees suggests that a willingness to serve is by no means lacking even in the prevailing anarchy of Indian universities.

American Peace Corps workers have never wanted for Indian helpers in their road-building projects; nor would Oxfam’s relief campaign in West Bengal refugee camps have been possible without the aid of young medical graduates from Maharashtra and Gujarat. If foreign organizations can persuade Indians to do constructive work, why cannot their own mentors do also? It is largely because of Oxfam’s representations that West Bengal medical colleges have now agreed to count an intern’s stint in a refugee camp as part of his training, but obviously this combination of academic learning and practical work needs to be extended on a far wider scale if universities are to live down Dr. P.D. Gajendragadkar’s criticism that they are irrelevant to “the problems of life and society.”

This, then, is how I remember the remarkable contribution of Indian university students and volunteers in the tumultuous days of 1971. Those Indian students moved mountains in 1971 as, indeed, the Bangladeshi students and others have done and are still doing in 2024.

Title: How to understand and respect people with disabilities- some ‘do's and don’ts’

People tend to talk in simple single syllable words to people who use wheelchairs, they shout at the deaf, and often address a blind person through someone else.

Representational image.

Julian Francis

My elder brother, James, who was born in 1943 with a genetic chromosomal abnormality, Down Syndrome, and who had a severe learning disability, died in 1999 in the U.K. as a result of other people’s negligence.  He died of bronchial pneumonia because doctors who were treating him did not take the time and trouble to find out exactly what was wrong with him.  He had been suffering with diarrhoea and they treated him for that without properly examining him at the residential care home in which he lived.  He died because he was unable to communicate with the doctors and his carers supposedly trained to look after people with such difficulties.  His birthday, which he always celebrated with a lot of fun and laughter among friends, even going to a local pub for a drink, was December 3.  This date, therefore, has special significance for me and my sisters, because, in most countries of the world, December 3 is observed as the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.

It is only right to ask ourselves if we ever take time to understand the problems, the challenges, the feelings and the aspirations of those people who live among us who, as a result of a disability or disabilities, find their lives more difficult to handle than most of us.  When we meet people with disabilities, due to our lack of knowledge, we often feel awkward and embarrassed as we do not know how to react, what to do, or what to say. I am writing down some practical advice which may help in the understanding of how people with disabilities feel. I draw on my own personal experience of growing up with a brother with a severe learning disability and later in life having a son, now 49 years old, with a similar disability. These experiences and knowing many other people with disabilities who have become close personal friends, have enriched my life and my work.

Having assisted, in 1990/91, in putting together the first preliminary draft of Bangladesh’s National Disability Policy, and having seen how slowly it made progress, I am well aware of how officialdom looks at the problems of the disabled. Although, 43 years ago, 1981 was observed as the International Year of Disabled Persons, the rights of persons with disabilities have always tended to be at the bottom of most governments’ budget plans, and so, it can only be stressed that much more work has to be done. Having said that, I am pleased to see that the Government in Bangladesh has been taking a much closer interest in the difficulties faced by persons with disabilities and that the Disability Welfare Act 2001 was amended and strengthened in Parliament through the Disability Rights and Protection Act, 2013. In addition, “Protection of Persons with Neuro-developmental Disability Trust Act, 2013” was also enacted. Significantly, multilateral, bilateral and INGO donors have now adopted the slogans ‘Leave Noone Behind’ and ‘Disability Inclusion’. 30 to 40 years ago all development programmes had to address issues related to women to be accepted by donors. So, very many years later, the rights of people with disabilities are now, at last, recognised!

My work over the years has been enriched by many friends in Bangladesh and elsewhere who have disabilities, and all the time I try to focus on the person and not on the disability and hopefully what I write below – and I first wrote most of these words 37 years ago - will help the Interim Government and government officials better understand what they have to do and how to relate to persons with disabilities. The best advice, however, is that if you do not know how to handle your relationship with a person with a disability, ask him or her for advice.  I hope these Do's and Don'ts will enrich the lives of those who read them and some of the millions of people with disabilities in Bangladesh.

-Don't treat a person with one disability as if she/he is disabled in other ways. People tend to talk in simple single syllable words to people who use wheelchairs, they shout at the deaf, and often address a blind person through someone else.

-Don't focus on a person's disability, focus on the person.

-Do ask if you can help- and how to help-if it looks as if help might be needed. You may be shy about offering help. The disabled person may also be shy about asking for it. And don't be offended if your help is not needed-persons with disabilities usually like to be as independent as possible. And don't be put off from offering your help at another time.

-Don't say "I wouldn't try that if I were you"-a disabled person is likely to be the best judge of what she/he can or cannot do.

-Don't show pity and say, "I don't know how you manage; I'd die if I couldn’t walk." It is often hurtful and, under the guise of praise, reinforces the sense of being different.

-Do treat children with disabilities as normally as possible-including not allowing them to misbehave. Disabled children need to learn the boundaries of acceptable behaviour, in their own society, just as other children do.

-Do identify yourself straightaway. A blind person can't always place you by a 'hello'.  It's hard for her/him to reply warmly, 'hello', if she/he doesn't know who you are. So, give a name and context; "Hello, it's Tasneem.  We met last week at Shahana’s house."

-Do make a special effort to remember the name of a person who is blind. Beginning with her/his name is the only way of letting him know that you are talking to her/him.

-Don't feel shy about saying things like "nice to see you" to a blind person. She/he may even say it back. It's impossible to avoid words connected with seeing-blind people aren't self-conscious about it and needn’t be.

-Don't grab a blind person's arm unexpectedly. You'll startle her/him. In fact don't hold a blind person’s arm at all! Allow her/him to hold yours. She/he is then safely half a step behind you and so is forewarned of what your next move will be by the change in your position.

-Don't say "here's a step”-say, "step up" or "step down." It's dangerous as well as embarrassing to be waving your foot in mid-air when the step actually leads down. Also if the step is exceptionally deep or shallow, do mention it.

-Don't leave doors half open. Shut them all the way or open them flat against the wall.

-Don't exclude a blind person from television. It gives her/him access to a world familiar to her/his sighted friends.

-Don't exclude a blind friend from outdoor activities. Ask if she/he would like to shop with you instead of your doing it for her/him.

-Don't chase a child away from a person with a learning disability (often, wrongly, referred to as 'mentally retarded') who might approach her/him.  It only perpetuates the feeling that there is something to be afraid and ashamed of if she/he reaches out to touch a child, take her/his hand and turn it into a friendly handshake-deflecting the attention away from the child and on to yourself

-Don't be afraid of a person with a learning disability. Very few are violent-and if they are among people, you can assume that they are not violent. Avoidance and rejection are among the most commonly upsetting things to people with learning disabilities.

-Do be honest and keep promises. Don't assume that a person with a learning disability doesn't understand or remember what you've said. As an example, my son Neil, now 49 years old, who has a severe learning disability, has a very good memory, an amazing sense of direction and a great sense of humour.

-Do take time to listen to someone who is mentally ill-and don't assume that she/he has no knowledge or opinions of value.

-Don't express pity for parents of 'retarded' children-their child is just as precious to them as any child is to any parent.

-Don't give advice, except to point someone in the direction of professional help if none is being given and some help seems necessary.

-Do remember that any practical help you offer may need to be given for a long period.

-Don't tell a person who is mentally ill to "pull themselves together". If they could, they would.

-Don't grab hold of a wheelchair without being asked. The occupant can easily be thrown out by an inexpert enthusiast. Remember to warn her/him if you are going to turn the chair round quickly. In fact, it's thoughtful to tell her/him whatever your next move is going to be.

-Do check with the person in the wheelchair if the speed you are pushing her/him at is comfortable.  Too fast-it's unsettling. Too slow-it's plain boring.

-Don't lift the wheelchair by the armrests-they'll probably come out in your hands. Do remember that the person may find it hard to hear what you are merrily chattering about-and since your voice, coming from behind, may not compete well with traffic noise. Also, from her/his vantage point, she/he may not be able to see what you are pointing to.

-Do chat to a person in a stationary wheelchair with your head on the same level. It's embarrassing always literally to be "looked down upon" and uncomfortable always to be looking up.

-Do ask her/him how to get a wheelchair up or down a flight of stairs-there are often simple mechanisms or techniques which the disabled person will know.

-Do keep your face clearly visible when talking to a deaf person. Face the light. If you stand with your back to the light or window then you may be silhouetted, wiping out the details needed for lip reading. Don't move around-your deaf friend will miss words each time you turn your face.

-Do not distort your face exaggeratedly to 'help' a lip-reader. The subtle signs she/he watches out for will be swamped by such contortions. And don’t shout-it doesn’t help and can distort hearing aids.

-Do bear in mind that someone who is deaf may be nervous of going out in the dark.  Already denied one sense, she/he may be uneasy about being deprived of another. Indoors, make sure she/he has easy access to a safe light. And don't forget to take a torch if you go out at night with someone who is deaf-shine it on your face when you speak.

-Don't remain silent if you can't make out what a deaf person is trying to say, or if her/his hearing aid is making a whistling noise. Be frank. How else is she/he expected to know?

-Don't condescend. A deaf person's voice may sound strange. But there's no need to behave as if he she/he has a learning disability as well.

-Do play music. People who are deaf can "hear" the beat through the vibrations. Deaf teenagers love records and dancing at discos-the louder the music the better.



Title: Infrastructure alone can’t solve Dhaka’s traffic crisis

Inadequate infrastructure and poor urban planning play their part, but the role of commuter behaviour should not be discounted, says Muntasir Mamun

Muntasir Mamun

Dhaka’s traffic gridlock has become one of the city’s defining frustrations.

While much of the blame is often directed at insufficient infrastructure and poor urban planning, a critical factor is frequently overlooked in discussions - the role of commuter behaviour. Despite the many government interventions we hear about—like intelligent traffic lights and more regulated bus services—the impact of these efforts will remain limited without addressing the habits of the people using the roads.

HOW COMMUTER HABITS WORSEN CONGESTION

Much of Dhaka’s congestion is due to commuters disregarding designated bus stops, boarding and alighting at any convenient point along the road. These random stops create choke points on busy streets, causing vehicles behind buses to form tailbacks that trigger a ripple effect that stretches traffic delays over hundreds of metres.

A single bus stopping for just one minute can delay hundreds of vehicles for up to 15 minutes, affecting traffic flow far beyond that initial pause. This “anywhere goes mentality” isn’t limited to buses—cars and rickshaws frequently park at random locations, blocking lanes and forcing other vehicles to navigate around them.

These habits create an unpredictable traffic pattern, where unplanned stops and irregular crossings disrupt the road’s natural flow. Dhaka’s already dense traffic suffers immensely as a result, with each individual’s actions multiplying into a citywide gridlock.

THE LIMITS OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY

Government measures to reduce congestion—like intelligent traffic lights, regulated bus systems, and new flyovers—are significant and necessary steps. Smart traffic lights, for example, adapt to real-time traffic flow to reduce wait times at intersections, and regulated buses can bring structure to Dhaka’s chaotic transport scene. However, these systems depend on consistent commuter behaviour to function effectively. Intelligent traffic lights require predictable vehicle patterns, while regulated buses need commuters to use designated stops. When people continue to flag down buses at any location or park cars in random spots, these technologies cannot function as intended.

While infrastructure improvements are crucial, they can only provide temporary relief unless they are paired with a shift in how people approach public transportation and road use.

WHAT IS MISSING FROM THE DISCOURSE?

Much of the media coverage on Dhaka’s traffic focuses on these interventions—promising technology and structured solutions to address the congestion crisis. Yet, the role of commuter habits is rarely touched on. Public discussions frequently disregard the impact of individual choices that clog roads and disrupt order, assuming that technology alone will solve the problem.

To create a sustainable solution, it is crucial for both policymakers and the public to recognise the shared responsibility of maintaining a functional transport system. If Dhaka’s residents continue to expect buses and rickshaws to function as personal taxis, halting on-demand and parking anywhere, no amount of infrastructure will be enough to keep traffic flowing smoothly.

A PATH FORWARD

A sustainable solution to Dhaka’s traffic woes will require a dual approach: infrastructure development alongside efforts to foster responsible commuter habits. Public awareness campaigns could encourage the use of designated stops and highlight the importance of following road rules. By understanding and addressing the human aspect of traffic congestion, we can create a culture of road use that supports, rather than undermines, these technological interventions.

In the end, the solution to Dhaka’s traffic crisis isn’t just about building more roads or installing smarter traffic lights. It is about us—commuters making conscious choices to contribute to a smoother traffic flow. By combining better infrastructure with a collective mindset shift, we can transform our roads from chaotic bottlenecks into a more manageable system for everyone.

Title: Empowering citizens – the game-changing idea Bangladesh needs now!

As billions are spent on surveillance, the untapped potential of citizen participation could revolutionise governance and accountability, says Mahmudur R Manna

Imagine a world where the power of billions of eyes is harnessed to create a more just, accountable, and efficient society. We often overlook the most advanced, readily available surveillance system - human eyes coupled with human intelligence. While governments and organisations spend billions on cameras, sensors, and centralised systems, the untapped potential of citizen participation could revolutionise governance and societal accountability.

Let me tell you a story that inspired this idea.

A STORY FROM THE NETHERLANDS

In 2015, I was on a business trip to the Netherlands, driving through an impeccable road that connected a critical port. Impressed by the road’s perfect condition, I shared my admiration with my Dutch colleague. His response surprised me:

“These roads remain in excellent condition because citizens actively report any issues. If someone notices a pothole or damage and reports it to the authorities, they are rewarded.”

This simple yet effective system incentivised citizens to participate in maintaining infrastructure. By giving them a target (reporting problems) and a reward (monetary incentives), the government created a self-sustaining, people-powered surveillance network.

BRINGING THIS VISION TO BANGLADESH

Now imagine applying a similar concept to every corner of Bangladesh, not just for roads but for every system that touches daily life. Citizens frequently complain about parking violations, illegal construction, environmental hazards, and corruption. But these complaints often go unheard, filed in the wrong places, or abandoned when no action is taken.

Why not turn this frustration into action? What if:

·        Every citizen becomes a vigilant partner in governance, equipped with an app to report violations?

·        Authorities acted on verified reports, imposing fines or penalties on violators?

·        A share of the fine or penalty was given to the reporting citizen as a reward?

This idea could create a virtuous cycle of accountability, citizen engagement, and revenue generation.

TACKLING PARKING MALPRACTICES

Take parking violations as a case in point. With a simple app:

·        A citizen spots an illegally parked car.

·        They capture a photo showing the violation and the vehicle’s number plate.

·        The report is automatically sent to the relevant authority.

·        If the violation is verified, a fine is imposed on the offender.

·        A portion of that fine is credited to the citizen as their reward.

This approach solves multiple problems simultaneously:

·        Citizens are motivated to keep public spaces orderly.

·        Governments collect more revenue through fines.

·        Social behaviour improves, fostering a culture of accountability.

SCALING THE IDEA

Parking is just the beginning. This model can extend to:

·        Road Conditions: Reporting potholes, broken signals, or missing signage.

·        Environmental Violations: Illegal waste dumping, pollution, or deforestation.

·        Health & Safety Issues: Reporting food adulteration or unsafe building practices.

·        Corruption Watch: Reporting bribery or misuse of public funds.

For example, farmers could report irrigation issues, students could highlight broken school facilities, and local businesses could flag tax evasion—all while earning rewards for their vigilance.

WHY THIS WORKS

Targets motivate participation. Giving citizens a clear role and responsibility ensures their involvement.

Incentives sustain engagement. Rewards encourage long-term participation and make governance a shared responsibility.

Technology enables scalability. Mobile apps and AI can make verification, tracking, and rewarding seamless.

Fines generate revenue to support the programme while rewarding participants.

THE POTENTIAL FOR BANGLADESH

Bangladesh, with its large, tech-savvy population, is uniquely positioned to lead this revolution. It already has a ready workforce. The millions of smartphone users in the country can become the government’s eyes and ears.

Increased fines can also be used to boost government revenue, funding better infrastructure and services.

And, hopefully, this could lead to a cultural shift as transforming complaints into action fosters a sense of ownership among citizens.

THE GLOBAL IMPLICATION

If this idea succeeds in Bangladesh, it can serve as a blueprint for the world. The model can adapt to any country, empowering citizens while reducing government dependency on costly surveillance systems.

THE CALL TO ACTION

Let’s stop looking elsewhere for solutions and start by empowering our own people. The eyes of Bangladesh are ready to build a more just, transparent, and accountable society.

All it takes is a commitment to trust citizens, reward their efforts, and act on their insights. The change begins with us. Let’s show the world how a small idea can create a ripple effect that transforms governance globally.

Will you join this vision?

Title: Gen Z votes matter in the US election

The youth turnout has risen in recent polls and could be a crucial factor in determining the course America will take

The 2024 US presidential elections are a moment of worry and anticipation for people across the world as they decide who will be the president of the world’s most powerful country for the next four years.

American youth, especially those graduating high school this year, should care about the election as their future is going to be directly impacted throughout their college years. This will affect student loans, housing, and the political climate of the US. Those eligible to vote should do so.

“The 15th Amendment (1870) extended voting rights to men of all races. The 19th Amendment (1920) prohibited the states from denying the vote on the basis of sex. The 24th Amendment (1964) sought to remove barriers to voting by prohibiting a poll tax. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 secured voting rights for adult citizens of all races and genders in the form of federal laws that enforced the amendments.,” according to the National Archives.

To qualify for voter registration in New York State, you must be a US citizen, be 18 years of age or older, be a resident of this state and the county, city or village for at least 30 days before the election, not be in prison for a felony conviction, not be adjudged mentally incompetent by a court, and not claim the right to vote elsewhere, according to the New York State election site.

According to Teen Vogue, a recent Harvard youth poll showed strong election enthusiasm among women, which may be a positive sign for Democrats and their nominee Kamala Harris.

The NAACP says that some of the key issues youth voters are interested in are climate change, healthcare, student debt, mental health resources, racial justice, and political reform. They want action to be taken in regard to these issues and are looking to make a better future for themselves.

Young people have been voting in historically high numbers in recent elections, according to the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University. The generation's turnout has increased. Now is the time for young Americans to exercise democratic rights and shape the future of the country.

Digital engagement with political content and greater access to information have encouraged more young people to vote.

Gen Z is more likely to be progressive and focus on the environment, the state of the economy, and the education system. It is also the most diverse in terms of race and ethnicity in the history of the US. As a cohort, they are sceptical of traditional politics and tactics and prefer candidates who promise big change. A lot of young people are worried about rising political tensions, violence, and misinformation and have many worries in mind.

Despite these concerns, we should vote anyway because that is how we ensure our voices are heard.

Title: Do we overhype the US election?

Every four years, the international media works itself into a frenzy over the fate of the US presidential race. Rajib Das asks, why?

The US presidential election is one of the most highly discussed events every four years, grabbing attention worldwide. The election determines the US president, often seen as one of the most influential leaders in the world. However, while the US election symbolises democratic norms, other American polls, like the midterm election of Congress's lower house – the House of Representatives - hold less significance and do not substantially impact international politics.

The United States is considered the impetus of global democracy, a defender of free speech, human rights, and a free press. In theory, these values are considered the pillars of democracy. However, the reality of US influence in global democracy often reveals a more complex landscape, sometimes starkly contrasting its on-paper ideals.

Though it was considered the uncontested superpower after the fall of Soviet Russia in the last decade of the 20th century, academics and political scientists such as John Mearsheimer and realist and neo-realist thinkers often argue that the US does not hold superpower status anymore. The rise of China in the global economy has now challenged US supremacy. The realists now see international politics as the arena of great power rivalry, where influence is divided among a few dominant players. This power structure is increasingly framed as a divide between the ‘West’, encompassing the US and its Western allies, and the ‘Global South’, a coalition of emerging powers focusing on China, Russia, and India.

Interestingly, in the Soviet era, this power struggle pitted the West against the East. After the fall of East Germany and then the rest of Soviet Russia, the axis of the rivalry pivoted. This is due to the geographical and strategic alignments. Russia again emerged as a formidable power to the East after the West's geographic and ideological boundaries ended due to shifts in Eastern Europe. When China came into the play, with India, Brazil and South Africa, creating BRICS, it formally reframed the two primary blocs of global dominance.

THE HYPE FOR THE US ELECTION

Then the question may arise: if the US no longer holds superpower status, why is there so much hype for the election?

Well, there are several key factors. Firstly, the United States has been viewed as a dominant player in global politics for a long time, with decisions made by its president significantly impacting international relations, trade, and security. As a result, the US election is not merely a national event; it reverberates worldwide. Additionally, the US makes its electoral process a subject of scrutiny and serves as a model for other democracies. This self-image heightens interest in the elections, prompting global observers to watch how democracy unfolds in the US. That also validates the president's power after a tight election win and serves as a model for how they want to be seen in the world.

As the president of the US holds nearly all the country’s executive power, it can be enlightening to look at the contest through the lens of behaviour personality theory. In the US, voters only really have a choice between two candidates due to the make-up of the system. As such, the focus of the global media is the behaviour of the candidates. For example, most of the voters will pick a president based on the performance of the current party in power. Because of that we eventually see candidates often attacking the personal characteristics of their opponents. Before Kamala Harris took on the Democratic nomination, Donald Trump directly attacked President Biden for not being physically and mentally fit. Ironically, the line of attack may have worked too well as the Democrats shifted to Kamala.

Since she entered the race, she has traded attacks and allegations back and forth with Trump. In many ways, the conflict hasn’t focused on political agendas or policies, but rather on their behaviour.

WHY DON’T OTHER ELECTIONS DRAW AS MUCH ATTENTION?

In March 2023, it was clear that Chinese President Xi Jinping would secure a third term in office, as the National People's Congress (NPC) voted overwhelmingly to abolish the two-term limit in 2018, potentially allowing Xi to remain in power for life. This change made the contest for the Chinese premiership less attractive as it effectively signalled that Xi would stay in charge indefinitely, reinforcing expectations of his continued leadership. It is a similar case with Russia. Last March, Vladimir Putin secured his fifth term with 88 percent of the votes.

Then there is the case of India, the largest democracy in the world. When India held its 19th election last May, there was some stir in the realm of international politics. Though Narendra Modi became the prime minister for a third consecutive term, there was a significant push from the opposition Indian National Congress and its allies. Despite the scope and competitiveness of the polls, the international media attention given to the Indian election is much more limited than the US polls.

While the West and the Global South may be struggling over any number of issues at present, the lack of competitive polls in Russia and China and the smaller influence of India ensures that the US polls are the most closely tracked. Moreover, the extensive domestic and international media coverage amplifies the election's significance, framing it as a pivotal moment for global governance and norms.

TRUMP ADDS TO THE HYPE

While the explanation above shows how any US election can become a topic of worldwide interest, notable policy distinctions between the competitors or the behaviour of candidates can also add to the hype. And, of course, Trump is a lightning rod for both points.

The former US president has always had a knack for engaging the attention of the media. It was what powered him to his historic win against Hillary Clinton.

After Trump took the reins in 2017, the world saw significant changes in the global order. In two years, Trump changed the status quo in the Middle East by breaking the nuclear deal with Iran. There were also some developments in the relations between North Korea and its Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un. Given his wild card reputation, many political scientists worried about the possibility of widespread war. But then, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump lost the White House to Joe Biden in 2020.

The possibility of Trump’s return raises questions about whether he will oversee another transformation of the global order.

Frankly, we know that, regardless of the election outcome, there will not be much change in US foreign policy, whether it is in Ukraine, the Middle East, Taiwan, or the South China Sea. Trump has, of course, commented on every situation in international politics, from the Ukraine war to the Middle East massacre of Palestinians. However, he could bring about another twist in the Iran-Israel conflict. Trump has also been talking for a long time about NATO's involvement in the Ukraine war.

During his last term, Trump spoke about his limited confidence in NATO, claiming 'he will not be paying for NATO if you (other countries) do not pay a similar amount of their GDP for the defence pact.

On the other hand, Kamala Harris has been adamant about NATO's strong support for Ukraine.

Another foreign policy talking point is the war in the Middle East, particularly Israel’s offensives in Gaza and Lebanon. Trump and Harris are both competing with each other to outdo their support for Israel. However, the deterioration in Washington’s relationship with Tehran under Trump’s tenure should be a point of note. The current Iran-Israel conflict has reached its peak due to direct attacks on each other’s territory. Trump’s firm stance against Iran may shift the calculus again.

While those of us outside the US may focus on foreign policy, Trump’s domestic politics are worth noting too. Perhaps most significant are the connections between his rhetoric and the ideology of white supremacy. Under his ‘Make America Great Again’ slogan, Trump has been a determined, vocal, and strong supporter of anti-immigrant policies whereas Harris and the Democrats are lightly in favour of immigration.

There is also the question of abortion rights, which is likely to be an important issue during the election. Trump has justified his position as a vocal anti-abortion campaigner, but it remains to be seen whether this increases his share of the vote.

Due to his ability to focus and direct media attention, Trump has become a key factor in why US elections draw so many eyes.

Title: Unlocking the untapped potential of Bangladesh's secondary data market

AI has become foundational to modern innovation and data is the critical input necessary to develop it, says Mahmudur Rahman Manna

Artificial intelligence, or AI, and advanced research have become foundational to modern innovation, enabling breakthroughs across industries, from healthcare diagnostics to precision agriculture and smart city planning. However, at the heart of every powerful AI model lies one critical element - data.

In today’s landscape, data is often described as “the new oil” because it fuels AI and machine learning algorithms, offering insights and capabilities that would otherwise be unreachable. Without diverse, high-quality datasets, even the most sophisticated AI models are ineffective.

The global big data market has been experiencing impressive growth, driven by the surge in demand across industries for robust datasets to fuel advanced analytics, AI, and machine learning applications.

According to Expert Market Research, or EMR, a leading market research and business consulting firm known for publishing over 100 research studies monthly, as of 2023, the big data market was valued at approximately $311.72 billion, with projections to reach a massive $1.09 trillion by 2032. This equates to a robust compound annual growth rate of around 14.9 percent over the forecast period. Key sectors contributing to this demand include healthcare, manufacturing, retail, and finance, where companies leverage large data volumes for predictive analytics, operational optimization, and customer insight generation.

Emerging economies like India and Brazil have already begun to harness their population-scale data as a valuable resource, demonstrating the potential to create exportable datasets that power international AI development.

Bangladesh stands at the forefront of this opportunity. With over 170 million people, a high population density, and rapid digital adoption, it is uniquely positioned to supply the data needed to meet global AI demands. This vast data reservoir spans sectors from agriculture to healthcare, where insights into local behaviours, health patterns, and market trends could be invaluable on the world stage. If managed strategically, Bangladesh has the potential to turn this underutilised data into a new, export-driven industry that could fuel both economic growth and digital transformation, establishing itself as a crucial player in the global data economy.

BANGLADESH’S COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE

Examining Bangladesh’s demographics, sector-specific data sources, and regional positioning can show why the country has a particular edge in data. This analysis reveals the unique potential Bangladesh holds and the factors differentiating it from other emerging data economies, like India and Indonesia.

SECTOR-SPECIFIC POTENTIAL

CHALLENGES AND MARKET POSITIONING

Bangladesh’s young, dense population and sector-specific data potential position it uniquely as a data provider in the global AI economy. The nation’s growth in digital adoption and mobile penetration, combined with a relatively low-cost structure and an emerging regulatory framework, makes it a highly competitive player in the data economy.

HOW TO DEVELOP A LOCAL DATA INDUSTRY

Developing a robust data-driven ecosystem requires a foundation of policies and infrastructure to facilitate effective data collection and management. A key recommendation is fostering partnerships between public agencies and private tech companies to establish a cohesive national framework. These partnerships can accelerate the digitisation of government records, encourage data-sharing agreements, and integrate data from multiple sectors like healthcare, agriculture, and commerce.

HOW TO MAKE DATA A SELLABLE EXPORT

To make data a valuable export commodity, it’s crucial to prepare it to meet international requirements. Steps for processing data include cleaning, labelling, and structuring, which are necessary to make raw data accessible and usable for specific industries, such as healthcare, logistics, and urban planning.

Countries like India and Israel have shown the importance of data standardisation for export. By investing in processes that align with standards from organisations such as the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, and the World Health Organization, or WHO, for health-related data, Bangladesh can build its reputation as a reliable data provider. Ensuring high data quality and compatibility increases its appeal to international buyers who require specific formats for AI training and analytics.

A practical way to position data for export is by organising it into “data packages” tailored to meet the needs of particular industries, such as retail, healthcare, and finance. These packages can be bundled by data type, region, or topic to attract global buyers who need curated, sector-specific information.

Partnering with global data marketplaces, such as Data Marketplace by IBM or Dawex, where raw data and processed insights are traded, could provide an additional avenue for Bangladesh to distribute its data assets internationally. These platforms facilitate transactions, giving Bangladeshi providers access to a broader market and enabling them to create revenue from data export while expanding global reach.

By building robust infrastructure, establishing governance policies, and creating tailored data products, Bangladesh can transform its vast population data into a high-value commodity that meets the needs of international industries. This approach can lay the groundwork for a sustainable data export industry that could contribute significantly to Bangladesh’s economic future.

BRANDING BANGLADESH AS A DATA DESTINATION

For Bangladesh to position itself as a global data destination, the government’s role is pivotal. Drawing lessons from countries like Singapore and Israel, Bangladesh could enact strategic policies that promote data-centric growth. Singapore, for example, has established data-friendly regulations, robust privacy frameworks, and incentives that encourage international firms to base their data operations there. Israel’s tech policies similarly created a fertile ground for its data-driven sectors, reinforcing the country's strength in exporting tech and data services.

Bangladesh can offer tax incentives, streamlined regulations, and lower setup costs to attract global companies looking to establish data processing centres. These incentives, coupled with the country’s competitive labour costs and an increasingly tech-savvy workforce, could make Bangladesh an attractive destination for international data operations.

Developing a local industry that specialises in data services—curation, annotation, and analysis—could elevate Bangladesh’s standing as a reliable data provider. This can include nurturing a skilled workforce to provide internationally compliant data services, exporting not only raw data but also trained experts and teams who offer high-quality data labelling and management services.

Investing in upskilling programs in data science, AI, and machine learning is essential to create a steady pipeline of skilled professionals. These programs could be in partnership with educational institutions and tech companies, allowing Bangladesh to foster a homegrown industry while attracting foreign clients.

CHALLENGES AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE GROWTH

Leveraging data as a national resource aligns with Bangladesh’s ambitions of accelerating its economic growth. Embracing data as an export commodity offers Bangladesh an avenue to diversify its economy, create jobs, and cultivate expertise that can help the country become a strong player in the global data economy. In doing so, Bangladesh can pave the way toward a future where it is recognised as a technology-driven nation, propelling itself into the ranks of upper-middle-income countries and beyond.

Several challenges stand in the way of Bangladesh’s emergence as a data hub. Chief among them are concerns about data privacy, a lack of widespread data literacy, and infrastructural limitations. Addressing these challenges is critical to achieving international data handling standards, as potential clients prioritise secure data management.

Robust policies on data privacy and protection are vital. Without a strong regulatory framework, attracting international clients who need to ensure data security will be difficult. Building a data protection infrastructure comparable to GDPR or CCPA would elevate Bangladesh’s reputation as a safe data destination.

To make data a sustainable growth sector for Bangladesh, it is necessary to formalise data policy frameworks by establishing comprehensive data protection policies that safeguard data rights while encouraging foreign investment.

Partnering with international tech firms could also be a major help as collaboration with experienced tech companies can bridge technology gaps and allow Bangladesh to adopt best practices in data management and export. Partnerships with international tech firms or even neighbouring tech-driven countries like India can foster technology and knowledge transfer, building a resilient and competitive data export industry.

Data holds transformative potential for Bangladesh, aligning seamlessly with the nation's aspirations for economic advancement and upper-middle-income status. By recognising data as a valuable resource, Bangladesh can fuel job creation, attract foreign investment, and diversify its export base. Embracing data as a strategic asset positions the country not only to contribute meaningfully to the global data economy but also to foster sustainable, technology-driven growth domestically. This strategy could elevate Bangladesh’s global standing, establishing it as a competitive and trusted destination in the world’s rapidly evolving digital landscape.

Title: Pedalling through parallels: Reflecting on cross-country trips in the US and Malaysia

Extended bicycle trips through the US and Malaysia uncover a shared ethos between a global superpower and a country often overlooked, says Muntasir Mamun

Muntasir Mamun

Travelling through Malaysia by bicycle, from Langkawi to Kuala Lumpur, revealed a fascinating perspective on a country often overlooked in comparison with the global superpowers. However, Malaysia’s journey and modern-day society, in many ways, resonate with my cross-country riding experience during my 2012 US trip from Seattle to Washington, DC.

The paths these two nations have taken—marked by diverse migration waves, urbanisation, cultural pluralism, and economic ambition—uncover striking parallels. My journey became not just a ride across miles, but an exploration of the shared ethos that connects these two nations.

Each year, we try to get away for a trip around mid-year, a routine that had almost slipped away this time. Accepting that we might not travel felt too much to bear, and so, we set off to Malaysia with our bicycles. It’s close by, with minimal visa hassles, and remains reasonably affordable. The journey started with a flight to Langkawi, one of Malaysia’s well-developed islands, especially geared toward tourists with its infrastructure, much like Bali in Indonesia, where we cycled a few years ago.

This time, the plan was the reverse journey—from Langkawi to Kuala Lumpur, covering about 550 kilometres in eight days, a leisurely pace with enough time to soak in the sights. Starting the trip meant boarding a ferry from the island to the mainland, an added delight.

A BACKBONE OF MIGRATION AND CULTURAL FUSION

Both Malaysia and the United States are products of migration. Malaysia’s early settlers from China, India, and surrounding Asian regions left indelible cultural marks that shaped its identity. These communities, each with distinct traditions and beliefs, have interwoven over time to create a unique cultural tapestry that, much like America’s, celebrates differences while forging a unified national identity. In both countries, migration was driven by opportunity and necessity—pioneers seeking a better life, just as immigrants in the US journeyed across continents.

Today, Malaysia continues to host millions of migrant workers who contribute to the nation’s growth, a trend reflected in the US, where immigrants have historically played a significant role in building the economy. Along the road, I met many workers from Bangladesh and other foreign countries, who have become a familiar presence in Malaysia’s small towns, much like the immigrant communities that characterise American life. Their presence is a reminder of the opportunities and challenges that migration brings to both countries, where people from all over the world seek new beginnings.

DIVERSITY AS A CORE NATIONAL VALUE

Malaysia, like the US, is a nation that holds diversity at its core. Though Islam is the official religion, Malaysia is home to substantial Buddhist, Hindu, and Christian communities. This vibrant mosaic of beliefs is integral to Malaysia’s national identity and resonates with the pluralism celebrated in American society, where freedom of religion remains a foundational value. Both nations emphasise tolerance and peaceful coexistence, where faith is a unifying thread connecting communities across cultural divides.

During the bicycle ride, we often stopped for water or rest, and it was impossible not to notice the beautiful mosques dotting the landscape—just as churches do throughout the US. These places of worship not only stand as symbols of faith but also reflect Malaysia’s openness and hospitality. People were always willing to help, offering directions or a place to rest, regardless of religious background. The warmth and respect I encountered at these stops underscored Malaysia's commitment to inclusivity, where the shared spirit of humanity bridges differences and fosters connection.

PARALLEL PATHS OF DEVELOPMENT AND MODERNISATION

In Malaysia’s rapid urbanisation and industrial growth, we find reflections of America’s transformation. Cities like Kuala Lumpur are centres of opportunity, drawing people from rural areas and smaller towns—just as urban migration transformed the United States in the 20th century. This rural-to-urban shift brings benefits and challenges in both countries, where balancing modernity and tradition becomes essential. Malaysia’s highways, infrastructure, and development projects, often funded by international partnerships, echo the American story of building modern roads and industries to connect people and facilitate economic growth.

As I cycled through different regions, the coexistence of modern highways with lush rural landscapes was striking. These roads symbolise Malaysia’s balance between rapid development and preservation of its natural heritage. Similar to the US’s scenic routes through towns and countryside, these roads tell a story of resilience, innovation, and the desire to connect every corner of the nation.

ECONOMIC GROWTH, CHALLENGES, AND A DRIVE FOR PROGRESS

Both Malaysia and the United States face the challenges of bridging socioeconomic divides, particularly between urban centres and rural communities. In Malaysia, the growth of the service, technology, and tourism industries has spurred economic growth, much like the US shift toward knowledge-based industries. However, both countries grapple with income inequality, a growing issue in fast-developing societies where urban prosperity often overshadows the struggles of rural areas. Malaysia’s smaller towns maintain a slower pace of life, where the benefits of modernisation sometimes take longer to reach.

As I travelled through these smaller towns, I was reminded of rural America, where resilience and community spirit often take precedence over the relentless drive for economic success. Both countries have also seen debates around equitable development, with grassroots movements advocating for more inclusive policies. In Malaysia, like in the United States, balancing growth with cultural and environmental preservation remains a key challenge for the future.

UNFALTERING PATRIOTISM AND NATIONAL PRIDE

In both Malaysia and the US, flags fly high and proud, symbolising a deep sense of national pride that is visible everywhere—from government buildings to small roadside stalls. The Malaysian flag is ever-present, echoing the patriotic displays seen across the United States. This shared expression of pride reflects a powerful connection to place and identity, transcending economic or social divides.

From a distance, it’s easy to mistake the Malaysian flag for the American one, especially for a first-time cyclist exploring Malaysia. The frequent presence of the flag in Malaysia reminded us of the similar displays of national pride found in the US, creating an unexpected bond between these two diverse nations.

Interestingly, only Bangladeshi workers seemed to recognize and respond to the Bangladeshi flag on our bikes, often waving in a friendly gesture of camaraderie. This felt similar to experiences in the US, where locals are quick to recognise and respond to their own flag but may not easily identify others.

Flags in both nations serve as reminders of the ideals each country strives to uphold—unity, diversity, and progress. This patriotic spirit brings communities together, as people in both Malaysia and the US take pride in the freedoms and opportunities their countries offer.

A SHARED JOURNEY OF RESILIENCE AND ADAPTATION

After eight days, we arrived in Kuala Lumpur with a renewed respect for Malaysia—a country whose story parallels the American journey in remarkable ways. From waves of migration and cultural diversity to economic ambition and social resilience, both nations have forged unique paths that echo each other’s values. Our journey through Malaysia unveiled a place where modernity meets tradition, where diversity is celebrated as a strength, and where ambition drives growth—a sentiment that feels both deeply American and uniquely Malaysian.

Travelling by bicycle, the slowest form of transport offers an extraordinary opportunity to truly immerse oneself in a place. The gradual shift in landscapes allows us to absorb every detail, revealing nuances that faster travel would miss. Each stop uncovers stories, and the steady pace of cycling makes you a part of them. We felt that both in Malaysia and the US, these parallels underscore a shared human experience that transcends borders. Through these explorations, we found not only the beauty of Malaysia but also a common narrative of resilience, unity, and the pursuit of a brighter future.

And with heartfelt gratitude, we say 'Terima Kasih' to Malaysia for embracing hundreds of thousands of our countrymen, allowing them to call this beautiful land their home.



Title: To transform Bangladesh, we must lead by example

To break free of old cycles and forge a Bangladesh free of inefficiency, opacity, and corruption requires a new mindset, says Mahmudur Rahman Manna

Bangladesh is witnessing a pivotal moment, with a seismic shift in political power leading to the installation of a new administration. Promising a return to the nation's golden era, the new leadership has caught everyone's attention. But are they at risk of repeating the same mistakes that have long plagued governance? Can leaders drawn from grassroots movements or non-government organisations successfully steer the bureaucratic machinery, or will they eventually become trapped in the very system they sought to reform?

There is a high likelihood that this new leadership, too, will end up as prisoners of the old administration's practices. Why? Because they appear to be focusing on reforming or punishing individuals and groups rather than tackling the fundamental issues with the system itself. This is a hallmark of the old guard - an approach that gets stuck in a cycle of assigning blame and seeking scapegoats, while the real issues remain unaddressed.

Instead, the new administration must break this cycle. They need to lead by example, starting with transparency and accountability in every step they take. The most impactful reforms are not about reshuffling people, but about changing the processes that govern them. Real change will come when they systematically address the underlying mechanisms that perpetuate inefficiency, opacity, and corruption.

For instance, the events of the first three days following the shift in power—such as the mass release of criminals from jails—raise questions that must be addressed openly. The administration must take responsibility for these actions and communicate clearly, showing accountability. Every decision, every appointment needs to be justified, with the public actively engaged in the process. This isn't just about optics; it's about building trust through consistent, transparent actions.

Moreover, appointments must reflect meritocracy. A health ministry needs a health expert at its helm; an IT ministry deserves an IT professional. The public will quickly lose faith if they see individuals without relevant expertise being appointed. Without addressing these fundamental flaws in the process, the new administration risks becoming indistinguishable from the old one.

To truly differentiate themselves, they must focus on systematic reforms—not by fixating on who did what in the past, but by redefining how the system itself functions. Only then can the promise of transformation move from rhetoric to reality.

A NEW MINDSET

The new administration must adopt a service-oriented mindset, seeing themselves not as rulers, but as service providers to the people. Leaders should recognise that they are employees paid by citizens, accountable to them at every turn. This means prioritising public welfare above all else and constantly striving for success and progress.

To achieve this, the administration should:

Answer to the people - Treat the people as stakeholders and engage with them as service beneficiaries. Every day should bring some level of success or progress that can be demonstrated to the public.

Provide a clear roadmap: Provide a detailed, transparent roadmap that outlines goals, milestones, and timelines. The public should have access to this plan and be involved in discussions regarding it.

Account for every action: Leaders must answer for every action, delay, or decision. Successes should be celebrated with the public, while setbacks should be openly acknowledged, with explanations provided on how they will be addressed. By being upfront, the administration can build credibility and trust.

LEAD BY EXAMPLE

To effectively implement a mindset of service and accountability by leading through examples, the administration can follow these steps:

Adopt daily public briefings: Conduct daily briefings where key actions, decisions, and progress are communicated to the public. This could be through press conferences, social media updates, or official bulletins. Transparency in communication fosters a culture of openness and helps maintain the public's trust.

Create a public dashboard for progress tracking: Develop an online dashboard that the public can access to see the progress of various initiatives. Include milestones, timelines, and real-time status updates. This makes the administration’s efforts tangible and demonstrates commitment to delivering on promises. Such a tool should be easy to navigate, allowing citizens to track the government’s progress in critical areas like infrastructure, health, and education.

Establish a feedback mechanism for citizens: Create an effective platform where citizens can provide feedback on government projects, policies, and services. A dedicated team should analyse this feedback, and actionable suggestions should be taken seriously. This mechanism ensures that the people’s voice will shape governance and helps leaders stay connected to realities on the ground.

Publicise policy rationale: For every major policy decision, provide a detailed public rationale. Publish documents and host open forums to explain the reasoning behind decisions, the expected impact, and how it aligns with public welfare. By doing so, leaders demonstrate that their actions are guided by logic and public interest, not by personal or political motivations.

Implement a service training program for officials: Train all government officials in public service values, communication, and transparency. Emphasise the importance of accountability and viewing themselves as servants of the people. This can be done through workshops, seminars, and leadership programs that focus on instilling a service-first mindset.

Lead by example to reinforce accountability: When a leader or official makes an error, use it as an opportunity to lead by example for accountability. Publicly acknowledge the mistake, outline corrective actions, and demonstrate what is being done to prevent recurrence. For instance, if there was a miscommunication leading to public dissatisfaction, the official involved should address the issue directly, providing both a genuine apology and a solution.

Foster inter-ministerial collaboration for better service delivery: Encourage collaboration among ministries to solve cross-cutting issues. For example, a project on improving healthcare facilities will require inputs from health, infrastructure, finance, and technology departments. Establishing inter-ministerial task forces with a clear mandate and regular progress reporting ensures better coordination and service delivery.

Engage local communities in decision-making: Whenever there is a new policy or a major development project, engage local communities in consultation meetings. By involving those directly affected, the administration can ensure that policies are grounded in local needs. For example, before constructing new roads or infrastructure, hold town hall meetings to gather input from residents and adjust plans accordingly.

Establish a performance evaluation system for officials: Create a transparent performance evaluation system to assess the effectiveness of government officials. Metrics could include service delivery, citizen satisfaction, responsiveness, and transparency. Make the evaluation results public, celebrating high performers and helping others improve through targeted training.

Demonstrate personal commitment: Leaders should consistently demonstrate the values they advocate, setting a strong precedent through their own behaviour. This could mean disclosing personal assets to demonstrate financial transparency, adhering to strict ethical standards, and being visible in their efforts to engage with the public. When citizens see their leaders practicing what they preach, they are more likely to believe in the transformation narrative.

CONCLUSION

To genuinely bring about a golden era of progress and prosperity, the new administration must break free from the legacy of superficial changes. Systemic reforms—anchored in transparency, meritocracy, and accountability—will be the true differentiators. Leading by example, fostering a mindset of public service, and engaging citizens at every step will transform rhetoric into lasting, meaningful progress. By addressing the root causes of inefficiency and corruption, the new leadership has the potential to deliver on their promises and truly reshape governance for the better.

Title: Islamic songs were performed at a Durga Puja event. Was it incidental or planned?

Was the controversy blown out of proportion on social media, and what is the responsible path forward? asks Mohammad Didare Alam Muhsin

Mohammad Didare Alam Muhsin

Durga Puja, the biggest religious festival for the Bengali Hindu community, has now come to a close. After the fall of the previous Awami regime in the face of the Anti-discrimination Student Movement, there was a different atmosphere for this year's Puja.

The interim government has extended the public holiday by declaring Thursday, Oct 10, a holiday by executive order to make this year's celebrations more joyful. In conjunction with the weekend and the Dashami public holiday on Sunday, this meant there were four consecutive days off for officegoers.

Since the mass awakening in July, there have been some isolated incidents of attacks on Hindu communities in different parts of the country. Student coordinators have alleged that, at least in some cases, the supporters of the fallen dictatorship have perpetrated these incidents to create communal unrest. There were attempts by some nefarious quarters to create communal unrest through such activities during previous Durga Pujas to allegedly gain a political advantage. Therefore, the interim government and the main political parties of the country are keeping a watchful eye to prevent any unwanted incidents during the Puja celebrations.

Though the celebrations have been peaceful on the whole thanks to careful vigilance, one incident has stirred controversy. On Thursday, an organisation named 'Chattogram Cultural Academy' performed two songs at a cultural event organised at the historic JM Sen Hall by the Chattogram Hindu community. The two songs were the famous Baul song 'Age Ki Sundar Din Kataitam' by Baul Samrat Abdul Karim and 'Shudhu Mosalmaner Lagi Aseniko Islam' written by Principal Chowdhury Abdul Halim.

After the performance, it came to light that the performance had been approved by Sajal Dutta, joint secretary of the Mahanagar Puja Celebration Committee. At the end of the performance, the singers were seen to thank the organisers for inviting them. Similarly, the programme presenter was also seen to applaud the singers for performing the music of a non-sectarian Bangladesh. The focus of the first song was on Hindu-Muslim harmony, while in my opinion, the second song highlights Islam's provision of equality for all religions.

However, other members of the Mahanagar Puja Celebration Committee later said that the performers had asked to perform at the event, not the other way around. Though the singers had Dutta's approval, a section of the audience did not take their performance well.

After a video of the incident went viral on social media, displeasure was expressed from various quarters. Based on the assumption that the performing organisation was pro-Jamaat, a campaign began to propagate the idea that activists from the Jamaat e-Islami and Islamic Chhatra Shibir went to the Puja pavilion and forced the performance of an Islamic song. This was propagated not only by people from the Hindu community but also by many who dislike Jamaat-Shibir politics. The local administration intervened to prevent the situation from deteriorating. Police have already arrested two music performers. However, there is no trace of Dutta, who approved the performance.

One of the main narratives constructed by the fallen autocracy to take and retain power was their stance against Islamic fundamentalism and militancy – which they propagated both at home and abroad. By this, they primarily meant the Jamaat-Shibir, but the BNP was also implicated as their ‘close ally’. This had been their main weapon to stay in power, making use of the West’s Islamophobia. Because of the anti-India stance of the nationalist and Islamist forces of the country, Bangladesh’s neighbour also wanted to see the fallen regime stay in power at any cost.

Even after the recent popular uprising toppled the dictatorship, their followers are believed to be attempting sectarian violence in various parts of the country to try and make the country's transformation appear to the West as an Islamist coup. Politicians and the media in India have also continued attempting to portray the country's changeover in the same vein. They aim to antagonise the Western world and turn it against the new government.

Undoubtedly, the Islamic and nationalist forces are now in a much stronger position in this new, post-uprising Bangladesh. However, this does not mean that there has been or is going to be the empowerment of any forces like the IS or the Taliban. The main reason why the narrative of the fallen autocracy and its patron, Indian Brahmanism, has not succeeded so far is that Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus is well-known across the world as an eminently secular personality. Moreover, I believe those appointed to the interim government formed under his leadership are almost all in the same vein.

The second reason why this strategy has not succeeded so far is that the country's Islamic and nationalist forces were careful not to allow the creation of any communal strife in the country since the changeover in power. This prevented the old regime from implementing its familiar strategy.

Despite the vigilance and awareness at the leadership level, it is not unusual for many ordinary activists and supporters to have an inadequate understanding of the situation. Therefore, we should ask – is the Chattogram Puja pavilion incident just an expression of innocent Hindu-Muslim friendship and harmony at the personal level, or a trap as part of a wider plot?

Whether they realise it or not, there is no denying that this incident has given the fallen autocracy and its Brahminical patrons a fresh tool to lay out a narrative of minority oppression in this country. It is already understood that they are trying to make the best use of this weapon by flooding the media and social media. Unfortunately, however, some forces associated with the student movement are also seen, due to their Jamaat-Shibir phobia, to join this propaganda and serve the purpose of the fallen dictatorship and its patrons.

Communal harmony is very important for the overall stability and progress of this country. The imperialist powers will always try to materialise their own interests by creating instability and division in Bangladesh. Therefore, it is difficult to say that they will not try again to use similar incidents in the future to try and destroy communal harmony. As such, everyone must take care and remain vigilant in this regard.

Title: We must address youth mental health

We need to advocate for children and people struggling and facing crises in our communities and globally, says Samira Tahsoon

Mental health is a fundamental part of life and the human psyche.

Oct 10 is World Mental Health Day and spreading awareness of the issue is crucial because fostering a welcoming and supportive environment can improve the lives of many who struggle with mental health issues. Though the topic is discussed now more than ever, lack of support has been an enduring issue. Stigmatisation and damaging environments can hinder treatment and people’s willingness to ask for help.

The rise in mental health cases we see nowadays is a product of more awareness and access to data but is also prompted by persistent issues that affect the lives of many such as war, poverty, abuse, etc.

Social media has been a leading factor in normalising the discussion of mental health issues or disorders. It not only makes those struggling feel seen, but also educates other people on the topic. It is important to bring that same supportive nature into our daily lives and support friends and family and ask them how they are doing. Mental health is about how we live day-to-day and how we deal with any emotion or situation and how we can build healthy relationships with ourselves. It is important to value yourself and your body. We need to be mindful of how we treat ourselves.

It is also important to have empathy and understand the struggles of others, especially children. This is particularly key for those living through traumatic situations. According to ReliefWeb “Almost all of the estimated 1.2 million children in Gaza are in need of mental health and psychosocial support (UNICEF 14/07/2024). Problems include depression in children as young as five, anxiety, regressive behaviours (e.g. bedwetting in children as old as 14), and suicidal thoughts.”

Children amidst war and conflict experience severe trauma. It is an issue of extreme concerning as they seemingly have no escape from the death and destruction around them. We need to advocate for children and people struggling and facing crises in our communities and globally. Children are the most vulnerable members of our society. We must, as a society, combat the erasure of their childhood and youth amid their daily struggles.

Title: Dias injury latest blow in Manchester City's calamitous run

Defender Akanji has returned to training after injury, boosting Guardiola's squad

Manchester City will be without defender Ruben Dias for three to four weeks with a muscle injury, manager Pep Guardiola said on Friday, another blow for the reeling champions whose hopes of hanging on to the Premier League title are dwindling.

City travel to Aston Villa on Saturday hoping to right the ship amid the worst run of results in Guardiola's managerial career that has them languishing fifth in the league table. They also have just one victory to show for their last 11 games across all competitions.

Dias was injured in City's calamitous 2-1 derby loss to Manchester United on Sunday.

"It was a muscular injury, (after) 75 minutes against Manchester United he felt something. He is so strong and he stayed on the pitch and now he is injured," Guardiola told reporters on Friday.

Fellow defender Manuel Akanji, however, returned to training this week after suffering an injury early this month, "which is good for us," Guardiola said.

City lost to United in spectacular fashion last weekend, leading in the 88th minute before their cross-town rivals scored two goals in less than two minutes.

Guardiola looked disconsolate after, and pointed the finger squarely at himself for the shocking run, telling reporters during a long and heartfelt post-game press conference that "I am not good enough."

His mood had improved by Friday.

"I just finished a game where we were close to winning and we lost. For the sequences that happened I was not happy," Guardiola said. "I tried to be honest with myself here right now in six or seven days ago, (but) if you fall down six times you have to stand up seven.

"I am fine. I am a normal person with feelings like all of us. When a situation is going well we are better and when it is not going well professionally we are more (focused) on what we have to do."

Just two points and two places behind Guardiola's team in the league table, Aston Villa will climb over City with a victory on Saturday at Villa Park.

Unai Emery's team have also had significantly more success than City in their Champions League campaign, where they are fifth in the standings with two games left in the league phase while City are languishing in 22nd.

"I'm not surprised. Top, excellent manager. (They had good success) qualifying for the Champions League and the results in the Champions League they speak for themselves," Guardiola said. "They are handling it well because when I have been in many clubs handling both competitions, they have done really well."

City lost 1-0 at Villa Park just over a year ago before rebounding to thrash Emery's side 4-1 in early-April. Guardiola said, however, there was little he could glean from those games.

"Why do you have to compare what happened?" the Spaniard said. "The past is the past, this is a new moment, you have to deal with it."



Title: Pakistan outplay South Africa to earn 81-run ODI win at Newlands

Shaheen Shah Afridi produced a spell of high-quality seam bowling as Pakistan claimed their One-Day International series against South Africa with a game to spare following a comprehensive 81-run victory at Newlands on Thursday.

Pakistan have an unassailable 2-0 lead ahead of the third and final fixture in Johannesburg on Sunday.

South Africa surprisingly sent the visitors into bat on a ground where it is known to be difficult to chase under lights, and Pakistan posted an above-par 329 all out.

Heinrich Klaasen provided the only real resistance for South Africa with an excellent 97 from 74 balls but was the last man out as they were dismissed for 248 in 43.1 overs, having been outplayed in all facets of the game.

Captain Mohammad Rizwan scored 80 from 82 balls to anchor the Pakistan innings, but the impetus for their total came from a superb 63 from 32 deliveries by Kamran Ghulam.

Babar Azam provided 73 in 95 deliveries with the visitors profiting from some sloppy South African fielding as they dropped numerous catches and were not accurate enough with the ball.

Debutant fast bowler Kwena Maphaka, 18, returned figures of 4-72 in his 10 overs, the pick of a disappointing bowling effort from South Africa.

Several of the home side’s batters got starts but Pakistan picked up wickets at regular intervals and Klaasen ran out of partners in the chase.

Afridi showed superb control and recorded figures of 4-47 as he ripped through the South African middle order, removing the dangerous David Miller for 29 to take the game away from the home side.



Title: Barcelona unhappy with recent run but will fight to the end, says Flick

They lead LaLiga with 38 points, ahead of Atletico and Real

Barcelona will battle until the end to win titles, according to head coach Hansi Flick, who said he was unhappy with their current situation as they look to avoid a third consecutive home defeat in LaLiga when they host Atletico Madrid on Saturday.

After a superb start to the season which saw them win 14 of their first 16 matches across all competitions, Barcelona lost their way domestically with Sunday's 1-0 home defeat to 15th-placed Leganes leaving them with one victory in their last six league games.

But they remain top of the LaLiga table with 38 points, level with second-placed Atletico and one point ahead of Real Madrid in third, with both their title rivals having a game in hand.

To make matters worse for the Catalan side, Atletico have been in terrific form ahead of the highly-anticipated clash at the Lluis Companys Olympic Stadium, having won their last 11 matches in all competitions.

"What I can feel in the city and the supporters know what the team is like. We lost five important players. (Attacking midfielder) Dani Olmo and (forward) Pau Victor are the (new) signings. The team has improved and is focused," Flick told reporters on Friday.

"We are not happy with the situation, but we are going to fight until the end of the season. We want to win titles, but we know it won't be easy. But we want to win, that's what we want to do tomorrow."

The German said there will be little room for error if they are to win against Atletico, but they were ready for the occasion.

"It's the end of the year. It's a great game. It's one of the best rivals. But today is Dec. 20 and we're first in LaLiga and second in the Champions League. We are not bad. We lost some points against Las Palmas (2-1 loss) and Leganes, we have to recover them," Flick added.

"Tomorrow is another game. We have a young team and we have to fight and improve. We want to achieve great things. But we know it won't be easy. We have to start fighting tomorrow. We are playing against great teams."

Barcelona have suffered a blow with winger Lamine Yamal suffering an ankle injury during their loss against Leganes. The 17-year-old Spain international is expected to be out for three to four weeks.

"We have to accept that he is injured and won't be able to play," Flick said.



Title: U-19 Women's Asia Cup: Bangladesh breeze past Nepal to set up final clash with India

The Tigresses beat Nepal by 9 wickets in Kuala Lumpur

Bangladesh have trounced Nepal by 9 wickets to secure a berth in the final of the Under-19 Women’s Asia Cup.

On Friday, the young Tigresses bounced back in style from their earlier loss to India in the Super Four stage opener in Kuala Lumpur.

In a rain-curtailed 11-over game, Nepal managed just 54 runs, which Bangladesh chased down comfortably in 9.5 overs.

Bangladesh will face India in the final on Sunday at the same venue.

After winning the toss, Bangladesh opted to field and immediately put pressure on Nepal. A combination of tight bowling and poor running between the wickets left Nepal struggling. Three of their first four wickets were run-outs within the first six overs.

Nepal's highest partnership was a 19-run stand between captain Puja Mahato and Sabitri Dhami for the second wicket. Dhami, the only batter to reach double figures, scored 11 off 12 balls.

Farjana Easmin, Anisa Akter, Fahomida Choya, and Habiba Islam chipped in with a wicket apiece for Bangladesh.

Chasing a modest target, openers Fahomida and Mosammat Eva got the Tigresses off to a flying start. Fahmida struck boundaries in consecutive overs, while Eva hit the only six of the match in the fifth over.

The opening partnership of 46 runs ended in the eighth over when Eva was bowled by Kusum Godar for 18 off 21 balls. However, Fahomida guided her team across the finish line with an unbeaten 26 off 32 balls, alongside Sumaiya Akhter, who added 10 runs off six balls.

Fahomida was named Player of the Match for her all-round performance.

Match Summary:

Nepal U-19: 54/8 in 11 overs (Dhami 11, Mahato 9; Farzana 1/13, Anisa 1/10, Fahomida 1/14, Habiba 1/11)

Bangladesh U-19: 58/1 in 9.5 overs (Fahomida 26*, Eva 18, Sumaiya 10*)

Result: Bangladesh won by 9 wickets.

Player of the Match: Fahomida Choya



Title: Bangladesh crush West Indies by 80 runs to complete T20 series sweep

After setting a daunting target of 190, the visitors bundle out the Caribbean side for 109 runs to win the third T20

Bangladesh have romped to a resounding 80-run win in the third and final T20 match against the West Indies to sweep the series 3-0. This is Bangladesh's biggest win in T20Is against the Caribbean side.

The Tigers had only achieved whitewashes in T20 series twice before: against England at home last year and against Ireland away in 2012.

However, this victory carries extra significance. Coming on the heels of a disappointing ODI series whitewash, and achieved without key players like regular captain Najmul Hossain Shanto, Towhid Hridoy, and Mustafizur Rahman, the triumph marks a memorable end to a challenging year for Bangladesh cricket.

The match in St Vincent on Friday morning Bangladesh time saw Parvez Hossain Emon returning to the side and giving the team a solid start with the bat. Jaker Ali then stole the show with a blistering knock, helping the visitors post a commanding total of 189 runs in their 20 overs.

In reply, the West Indies collapsed for just 109 runs to hand a remarkable victory to Bangladesh.

Jaker lit up the match with a breathtaking 72* off just 41 balls, smashing six sixes and displaying incredible skill, power, and match awareness. Earlier in the tour, he impressed with two brilliant Test innings and solid ODI performances. He capped off the T20 series by dismantling the West Indies bowlers with ease.

Once Jaker set the tone, the Bangladeshi bowlers completed the job with minimal fuss. Rishad Hossain, who has had an outstanding year, posted his career-best figures of 3 wickets for 21 runs. Taskin Ahmed, Mahedi Hasan, and Hasan Mahmud also bowled with precision and rhythm to put the squeeze on one of the most dangerous teams in cricket's shortest format.

DOMINANT START

After winning toss and electing to bat, Bangladesh dominated from the get-go in Kingstown. Parvez, stepping in for the injured Soumya Sarkar, began with a classy boundary and soon showcased his power hitting. Alongside skipper Litton Das, he put up a brisk opening stand of 40 runs in the first four overs.

However, Litton’s promising start, highlighted by three elegant boundaries, ended in disappointment as he was dismissed for a run-a-ball 13. Parvez followed soon after, falling for a quickfire 39 off 20 balls, including four boundaries and two sixes.

The momentum slowed after Tanzid Hasan’s brief cameo, where he struck a six before being dismissed. The Tigers managed only 36 runs between the fifth and 10th overs. Mehidy Hasan Miraz attempted to hit the accelerator, scoring a handy 29 off 22 balls, but his innings ended prematurely.

Then came Jaker's moment. Starting cautiously with just 10 runs off 13 balls, he switched gears in the 14th over with a slog-swept six off Gudakesh Motie. Surviving a near run-out, Jaker took complete control, dominating the West Indies bowlers. His range of shots cleared every part of the ground—long-on, mid-wicket, and extra cover.

Despite quick dismissals of Shamim Hossain (2) and Mahedi (0), Jaker continued the onslaught. In the last five overs, he smashed five sixes and two boundaries, including a colossal 95-metre six off Obed McCoy. He brought up his fifty in style with a boundary off Alzarri Joseph and finished the innings by hammering three sixes in a 25-run final over as Bangladesh ended with a commanding total of 189 for 6.

CLINICAL BOWLING DISPLAY

Defending the target, Bangladesh struck early. Taskin bowled an outswinger followed by an inswinger to trap Brandon King leg-before for a duck in the first over.

Mahedi then dismissed debutant Justin Greaves in the second over. While Johnson Charles and Nicholas Pooran counterattacked briefly, adding 34 runs in three overs, Bangladesh hit back quickly. Mahedi dismissed Pooran (15 off 10) for the third time in the series, and Hasan Mahmud kept Roston Chase scoreless. Rishad’s brilliant direct hit ran out Charles (18 off 23), and soon after, he dismissed Rovman Powell with the ball.

The West Indies collapsed, losing four wickets for just 14 runs, leaving them teetering at 60/6. Romario Shepherd tried to rescue his side with a spirited 33 off 27 balls, but his efforts only helped the hosts cross 100 as Bangladesh cruised to a comprehensive victory.

Brief Score:

Bangladesh: 189/7 in 20 overs (Litton 14, Parvez 39, Tanzid 9, Miraz 29, Jaker 72* (41 balls, 6 sixes), Shamim 2, Mahedi 0, Tanzim 17, Rishad 0*; Shepherd 4-0-30-2, Joseph 4-0-59-1, Chase 4-0-15-1, Motie 3-0-30-1)

West Indies: 109 in 16.4 overs (King 0, Charles 23, Greaves 6, Pooran 15, Chase 0, Powell 2, Shepherd 33, Akeal 31, Motie 12, Joseph 1, McCoy 5, Seales 4*; Rishad 4-0-21-3, Taskin 3.4-0-30-2, Mahedi 3-0-13-2, Hasan 3-0-9-1, Tanzim 3-0-31-1)

Result: Bangladesh won by 80 runs

Series result: Bangladesh won the 3-match series 3-0

Player of the Match: Jaker Ali

Player of the Series: Mahedi Hasan

Reigning world champions Argentina have kept top spot in the final FIFA men's world ranking of 2024 for a second consecutive year, with no changes in the top 10 of the latest list published on Thursday.

Lionel Scaloni's Argentina, who were crowned Copa America champions for a record 16th time after they beat Colombia in July, continue to lead the way ahead of second-placed France and Euro 2024 winners Spain in third.

Euro runners-up England, Brazil, Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and Germany were next in the top 10.

Angola were the biggest mover of the year, climbing 32 places to finish 85th.
