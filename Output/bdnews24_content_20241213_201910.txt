The new prime minister is set to navigate political gridlock and tackle a critical budget crisis

French President Emmanuel Macron named Francois Bayrou as his fourth prime minister of 2024 on Friday, charging the veteran centrist with steering the country out of its second political crisis in the past six months.

The priority for Bayrou, a close Macron ally, will be passing a special law to roll over the 2024 budget, with a nastier battle over the 2025 legislation looming early next year. Parliamentary pushback over the 2025 bill led to the downfall of former Prime Minister Michel Barnier&#39;s government.

Bayrou, 73, is expected to put forward his list of ministers in the coming days, but is likely to face the same difficulties as Barnier in steering legislation through a hung parliament comprising three warring blocs. His proximity to the deeply unpopular Macron will also prove to be a vulnerability.

Jordan Bardella, president of the far-right National Rally, or RN, party, said it would not be calling for an immediate no-confidence motion, while fellow RN leader Marine Le Pen said Bayrou should listen to the opposition&#39;s budgetary wishes.

Reaction to Bayrou&#39;s appointment on the left was more mixed.

Communist leader Fabien Roussel said his party would hold fire against Bayrou, as long as he did not ram through legislation.

However, far-left France Unbowed party leaders said they would be seeking to remove Bayrou, and Greens boss Marine Tondelier said she would support a no-confidence motion if Bayrou ignored their tax and pensions concerns.

France&#39;s festering political malaise has raised doubts about whether Macron will complete his second presidential term, which ends in 2027. It has also lifted French borrowing costs and left a power vacuum in the heart of Europe, just as Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House.

Macron spent the days after Barnier&#39;s ouster speaking to leaders from the conservatives to the Communists in an effort to lock in support for Bayrou. The RN and France Unbowed were excluded.

There was no immediate comment from the conservative Les Republicains party, which supported the previous government, nor from Socialist Party leaders, whose involvement in Bayrou&#39;s coalition may come with a hefty price tag in next year&#39;s budget.

&quot;Now we will see how many billions the support of the Socialist Party will cost,&quot; a government adviser said on Friday.

NO LEGISLATIVE ELECTION BEFORE SUMMER

Macron will hope Bayrou can stave off no-confidence votes until at least July, when France will be able to hold a new parliamentary election, but his own future as president will inevitably be questioned if the government should fall again.

Bayrou, the founder of the Democratic Movement, or MoDem, party which has been a part of Macron&#39;s ruling alliance since 2017, has himself run for president three times, leaning on his rural roots as the longtime mayor of the south-western town of Pau.

Macron appointed Bayrou as justice minister in 2017 but he resigned only weeks later amid an investigation into his party&#39;s alleged fraudulent employment of parliamentary assistants. He was cleared of fraud charges this year.

Bayrou&#39;s first real test will come early in the new year when lawmakers need to pass a belt-tightening 2025 budget bill.

However, the fragmented nature of the National Assembly, rendered nigh-on ungovernable after Macron&#39;s June snap election, means Bayrou will likely be living day-to-day, at the mercy of the president&#39;s opponents, for the foreseeable future.

Barnier&#39;s budget bill, which aimed for 60 billion euros in savings to assuage investors increasingly concerned by France&#39;s  percent deficit, was deemed too miserly by the far-right and left, and the government&#39;s failure to find a way out of the gridlock has seen French borrowing costs push higher still.

The insurgents seize the last remaining junta-controlled border outpost, the BGP-5 battalion near Maungdaw

The Arakan Army (AA), a rebel group in Myanmar, has reportedly captured the town of Maungdaw in Rakhine state amid the ongoing conflict with government forces.

Consequently, the entirety of the 270km Bangladesh-Myanmar border is now under the control of the AA, according to a BBC report.

The insurgents seized the last remaining junta-controlled border outpost, the BGP-5 battalion near Maungdaw, on Dec 8 following months of intense fighting.

Videos released by the AA show their forces besieging the outpost with heavy gunfire, while Myanmar&rsquo;s air force launched counterattacks.

Since the military coup in 2021, which ousted Myanmar&rsquo;s democratically elected government, the country has been embroiled in a devastating civil war. The AA has been actively fighting the junta for over eight months.

Security analysts note that some Rohingya-aligned groups in Rakhine, including the Arakan Rohingya Army (ARA) and the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), initially sided with the junta. However, the latest defeat marks another significant setback for coup leader Gen Min Aung Hlaing, as the junta continues to lose strategic towns to the AA.

Earlier this year, military units, including the BGP-5 battalion, were withdrawn from Maungdaw in September. The compound, spanning approximately 20 hectares, was built on land formerly occupied by the Rohingya village of Maung Thugyi, which was burned and cleared during the military&rsquo;s violent crackdown on the Rohingya in 2017.

The scale of the fighting in Maungdaw since June suggests that the junta has suffered heavy losses, with reports of hundreds of soldiers killed. On Dec 7, the AA announced the capture of over 30 junta military camps in Rakhine&rsquo;s Ann Township, repelling air and ground attacks.

Reports indicate that Myanmar soldiers began surrendering in Maungdaw. Videos from the AA show soldiers emerging with white flags, many injured or limping. Inside the outpost, footage reveals the devastation, with piles of bodies and AA fighters celebrating their victory.

The AA claimed that over 450 junta soldiers were killed during the Maungdaw siege. They released images of captured Brig Gen Thurein Tun and other officers kneeling beneath a raised AA banner.

Pro-military commentators in Myanmar have expressed despair on social media following the fall of BGP-5, underscoring the AA&#39;s growing strength and effectiveness.

Although the AA was established relatively late, in 2009, it has emerged as one of Myanmar&rsquo;s most formidable rebel forces. However, questions remain about how the group will treat the approximately 600,000 Rohingya still living in Rakhine, especially after the military expelled over 700,000 Rohingya in 2017.

A Rohingya man who recently fled Maungdaw to Bangladesh described widespread destruction. &quot;Eighty per cent of the housing in Maungdaw and the surrounding villages has been destroyed,&quot; one Rohingya man who left Maungdaw recently for Bangladesh told the BBC.

&quot;The town is deserted. Almost all the shops and houses have been looted.&quot;

Relations between the AA and the Rohingya population have long been strained, and tensions have escalated further. Many Rohingya groups in Bangladesh refugee camps initially aligned with the junta and are now in a precarious position.

The AA has also targeted Rohingya militias tied to the junta, including the ARA, ARSA, and the Rohingya Solidarity Organisation, forcing them to abandon their bases.

Earlier this year, leaders of some Rohingya groups sought refuge in Bangladesh with weapons but were detained by local authorities.

The Myanmar government continues to deny the Rohingya citizenship, and many in Rakhine believe they should not remain in the region. A Rohingya man said, &quot;Our situation today is even more difficult than it was under the rule of the military junta.&quot;

US President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said he was picking Kari Lake, a former news anchor and a hardline Republican who failed to win an Arizona Senate seat last month, to be the director of US government-funded media outlet Voice of America.

Trump, in a post on his Truth Social site, said Lake will &quot;ensure that the American values of Freedom and Liberty are broadcast around the World FAIRLY and ACCURATELY, unlike the lies spread by the Fake News Media.&quot;

Lake, a strong Trump supporter who has echoed his false claims about fraud at the 2020 election, also lost the governor&#39;s race in swing state Arizona in 2022 and was previously an anchor at Phoenix-based Fox 10.

Voice of America (VOA) is an international media broadcaster that operates in more than 40 languages online and on radio and television.

During his first term in office, Trump clashed with VOA and accused it of amplifying Chinese propaganda after it showed a segment on a light show marking the reopening of Wuhan, the city where the coronavirus pandemic first emerged.

He has suggested in the past that vaccines might be linked to autism

US President-elect Donald Trump in an interview published on Thursday said he will be talking to Robert F Kennedy Jr, his nominee to run the Department of Health and Human Services, about ending childhood vaccination programmes.

When asked if he would sign off if Kennedy decided to end childhood vaccinations programmes, Trump told Time magazine, &quot;we&#39;re going to have a big discussion. The autism rate is at a level that nobody ever believed possible. If you look at things that are happening, there&#39;s something causing it.&quot;

When asked if the discussion could result in his administration getting rid of some vaccinations, Trump said: &quot;It could if I think it&#39;s dangerous, if I think they are not beneficial, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be very controversial in the end.&quot;

Asked in the Nov 25 interview if he thinks childhood autism is linked to vaccines, Trump said: &quot;No, I&#39;m going to be listening to Bobby,&quot; referring to Kennedy. Trump said he had a lot of respect for Kennedy and his views on vaccinations.

Kennedy, who opposed state and federal COVID-19 restrictions and was accused of spreading misinformation about the virus, has for years sown doubts over the safety and efficacy of vaccines, including asserting a debunked link between vaccines and autism.

Trump has suggested in the past that vaccines might be linked to autism. &quot;I want to see the numbers,&quot; he said. &quot;At the end of the studies that we&#39;re doing, and we&#39;re going all out, we&#39;re going to know what&#39;s good and what&#39;s not good.&quot;

RETRACTED AND DISCREDITED

Many of the claims that vaccines cause autism can be traced to a retracted 1998 study published in medical journal The Lancet. The paper, written by British doctor Andrew Wakefield, has been widely discredited.

Research, including a 2014 meta-analysis of studies involving more than 1.2 million children, found no association between vaccines and autism.

Autism advocacy group Autism Speaks says it &quot;remains aligned with the scientific consensus, which confirms that vaccines do not cause autism.&quot;

Former FDA commissioner and current Pfizer board member Scott Gottlieb has said if Kennedy follows through on his intentions to end vaccine mandates &quot;it will cost lives in this country.&rdquo;

He said lower vaccination rates could lead to large outbreaks of once nearly eradicated diseases like measles. &quot;For every 1,000 cases of measles that occur in children, there will be one death. And we are not good in this country at diagnosing and treating measles,&rdquo; Gottlieb told CNBC last month.

Kennedy disputes the anti-vaccine tag, but chaired the Children&rsquo;s Health Defence, a nonprofit organization that focuses on anti-vaccine messaging.

&quot;He (Kennedy) does not disagree with vaccinations, all vaccinations. He disagrees probably with some,&quot; Trump said.

If he is confirmed to run HHS, Kennedy would oversee the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, which controls what vaccines are recommended for Americans and when they should receive them. It also runs the Vaccines for Children programme that provides free vaccines for some children.

The remarks are in line with a comment Trump made in an interview with Meet The Press on Sunday in which he said that the potential risks from vaccines should be studied.

&quot;I think vaccines are &mdash; certain vaccines &mdash; are incredible. But maybe some aren&rsquo;t. And if they aren&rsquo;t, we have to find out,&quot; he said.

During a presidential debate in his 2016 White House campaign, Trump appeared to embrace the debunked autism link. He said he was &quot;totally in favour of vaccines,&quot; but suggested spreading out recommended inoculations over a longer period of time. &quot;And I think you&#39;re going to have, I think you&#39;re going to see a big impact on autism.&quot;

The moves come after the president signed an unconditional pardon for his son Hunter

Outgoing US President Joe Biden said on Thursday that he was pardoning 39 people convicted of non-violent crimes and commuting the sentences of nearly 1,500 others who were serving long prison terms.

The moves come over a week after the president signed an unconditional pardon for his son Hunter.

Officials said last week that the White House was listening to demands for Biden to extend the same grace to thousands of people wronged by the US judicial system.

The commutations on Thursday were announced for those who were placed on home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Biden said these people would have received shorter sentences if charged under today&#39;s laws, policies and practices.

Sources had told Reuters last week that the pardons being discussed included those convicted of nonviolent drug offenses and people identified by civil rights groups as unjustly incarcerated.

&quot;As president, I have the great privilege of extending mercy to people who have demonstrated remorse and rehabilitation, restoring opportunity for Americans to participate in daily life and contribute to their communities, and taking steps to remove sentencing disparities for non-violent offenders, especially those convicted of drug offenses,&quot; Biden said.

The president added that he will take more steps in the weeks ahead and that his administration will continue reviewing clemency petitions.

US Rep Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, one of the leading Democrats behind a letter to Biden last month urging him to issue clemency to Americans with nonviolent offenses, commended the president for taking &quot;meaningful and historic action.&quot;

Her statement noted that he could take further steps to exercise his power during his remaining 39 days in office.

The White House said that the clemencies granted by Biden were the most ever in a single day.

The list primarily includes Americans placed under home confinement during the Covid-19 pandemic to mitigate the spread of the virus, experts say, rather than many individuals civil rights groups have been advocating for.

&quot;We do think he can pardon more people - specifically people who are currently incarcerated and might have lower sentences if they were convicted today,&quot; said Tierra Bradford, senior program manager at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.

US President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has saidthat he would act on his first day in office to pardon rioters involved in the Jan 6, 2021, Capitol attack, further building expectations for a broad granting of clemency.

Israel killed 13 Palestinians in two airstrikes in Gaza on Thursday that Gaza medics and Hamas said were part of a force protecting humanitarian aid trucks. Israel&#39;s military said they were Hamas militants trying to hijack the shipment.

Many of those killed in the attacks on Rafah and Khan Younis in southern Gaza had links to Hamas, according to sources close to the group. The 13 were among 36 Palestinians killed in separate Israeli attacks on Thursday, the medics said.

The Israeli military said in a statement the two airstrikes aimed to ensure the safe delivery of humanitarian aid and accused Hamas members of planning to prevent the aid from reaching Gaza civilians who need it.

The statement said the Hamas members aimed to hijack the aid &quot;in support of continuing terrorist activity&quot;.

Armed gangs have repeatedly hijacked aid trucks after they roll into the enclave, and Hamas has formed a task force to confront them. The Hamas-led forces have killed over two dozen members of the gangs in recent months, Hamas sources and medics said.

The Palestinian news agency WAFA said those killed in the two airstrikes were guarding the aid trucks.

Hamas said Israeli military strikes have killed at least 700 police tasked with securing aid trucks in Gaza since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023. It has accused Israel of trying to protect acts of looting and &quot;creating anarchy and chaos to prevent aid from reaching the people of Gaza&quot;.

Later on Thursday, the Israeli military ordered residents of several districts in the heart of Gaza City to evacuate, citing new rocket launches from those areas that it would respond to.

&quot;This is a pre-warning before an attack,&quot; read the military statement posted on X. The warning was also channeled to some residents through audio and written text on their mobile phones.

The evacuation orders caused a new wave of displacement. At nightfall, dozens of families streamed out of the areas heading toward the center of the city.

ISRAELI STRIKES IN GAZA CITY, CENTRAL GAZA

Children were among seven people killed when a residential building in Gaza City&#39;s al-Jalaa Street was bombed in a separate attack, WAFA said.

Another Israeli bombing killed 15 people in a house where displaced people were taking shelter, west of Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip, medics and WAFA said.

In the northern Gaza refugee camp of Jabalia, where the army has operated since October, health officials said an orthopedic doctor, Saeed Judeh, was shot dead by Israeli forces while on his way to Al-Awda Hospital where he usually treated patients.

The health ministry said his death raised to 1,057 the number of healthcare workers killed since the war began.

Months of ceasefire efforts by Arab mediators, Egypt and Qatar, backed by the United States, have failed to conclude a deal between the two warring sides.

On Wednesday, the United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly voted to demand an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire and the immediate release of all hostages seized in Israel in October 2023 and held by Hamas in Gaza.

The war in the Palestinian enclave began after Hamas gunmen stormed into Israeli communities, killing around 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages back to Hamas-run Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.

Since then, Israel&#39;s military has leveled swathes of Gaza, driving nearly all of its 2.3 million people from their homes, giving rise to deadly hunger and disease and killing more than 44,800 people, according to Palestinian health authorities.

In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where violence has surged since the Gaza war began, Israeli forces shot dead two Palestinians, at least one of them a militant, in separate raids in Nablus and Qalqilya, Palestinian and Israeli officials said.

Around 810 Palestinians, including many militants and civilians, have been killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank since October 2023.

President-elect Donald Trump is now considering tapping Richard Grenell, his former intelligence chief, to be a special envoy for Iran, according to two people familiar with the transition plans.

&quot;He&#39;s definitely in the running,&quot; said a person familiar with transition deliberations, who asked not to be identified.

No final decisions on either personnel or strategy on Iran have been made official yet by Trump, including whether to slap fresh sanctions on the country, pursue diplomacy or both in order to halt their nuclear program.

Trump&#39;s plans for the role have not previously been reported. Neither Trump&#39;s team nor Grenell responded to requests for comment.

&quot;Richard Grenell is a fabulous person, A STAR. He will be someplace, high up!&quot; Trump said in a post on his social media platform late Wednesday following the Reuters report.

Grenell, in a separate post on X, called the report &quot;wrong&quot; but gave no other details.

Still, Trump&#39;s consideration of a key ally for such a posting sends a signal to the region that the new US president may be open to talks with a country he has previously threatened and whose elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps have sought to assassinate him, according to the US government. Iran has denied the claim.

In the role, Grenell is expected to be tasked with speaking with countries in and beyond the region about the Iran issue as well as taking Tehran&#39;s temperature on possible negotiations, said one of the people.

Iran&#39;s President Masoud Pezeshkian, who is viewed as relatively moderate, said following Trump&#39;s election that Tehran must &quot;deal with the US&quot; and &quot;manage&quot; relations with its arch-foe.

Iran has suffered a series of strategic setbacks, including Israel&#39;s assault on Tehran&#39;s proxy militias Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon and the ouster of Iranian ally Bashar al-Assad in Syria.

But tensions remain high more than a year after Hamas attacked southern Israel, launching the Gaza war. Meanwhile, other Iranian proxies have attacked US, Israeli and other Western targets, and Tehran has accelerated its nuclear program while limiting the UN nuclear watchdog&#39;s ability to monitor it.

It&#39;s not the first job Trump has considered for Grenell, who served as Trump&#39;s ambassador to Germany, a special presidential envoy for Serbia and Kosovo peace negotiations, and as acting director of national intelligence during Trump&#39;s 2017-2021 term.

After campaigning for Trump in the lead up to the Nov 5 election, he was a top contender to be secretary of state and for special envoy for the Ukraine war. Those jobs went to US Senator Marco Rubio and retired lieutenant general Keith Kellogg, respectively. Trump takes office next month.

During his first term in office, in 2020, Trump ordered a US air strike that killed Iran&#39;s top military commander, Qassem Soleimani.

Trump in 2018 also reneged on a nuclear deal struck by his predecessor Barack Obama in 2015 and re-imposed US economic sanctions on Iran that had been relaxed. The deal had limited Iran&#39;s ability to enrich uranium, a process that can yield fissile material for nuclear weapons.

Iran now is &quot;dramatically&quot; accelerating enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% level that is weapons grade, the UN nuclear watchdog chief told Reuters last week. Iran says its nuclear program only serves peaceful purposes.

Two senior members of Taiwan&#39;s government are in the United States to meet people connected to President-elect Donald Trump&#39;s transition team, five sources told Reuters, in an effort by Taiwan to establish ties with the incoming administration.

Lin Fei-fan and Hsu Szu-chien, both deputy secretaries-general of Taiwan&#39;s National Security Council and several of their staff have travelled to the Washington area for meetings through this week, the sources said on condition of anonymity.

Reuters was not able to confirm who from the US side would join the meetings or the agenda.

Taiwan&#39;s de facto embassy in Washington, China&#39;s embassy and the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment.

The visit by Lin and Hsu comes as China&#39;s military has stepped up activity near the Taiwan Strait, in what Taiwan has said is Beijing&#39;s effort to set a &quot;red line&quot; for the incoming Trump administration and US allies.

One of the sources said the meetings were with individuals in Trump transition circles but would not include nominees for top positions in Trump&#39;s next administration, given sensitivity in Beijing over any talks between Taiwanese and US officials.

The meetings are with &quot;Republicans likely to populate mid-tier political positions&quot; in the Trump administration, a second source said. A third source said it was &quot;safe to say&quot; Lin and Hsu were meeting the Trump transition team.

A fourth source added that visits to the United States at such a level are not rare and that they are to meet &quot;old friends&quot;, including people in Trump&#39;s circle.

The United States does not have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, a democratically governed island that China claims as its own territory. Taiwan rejects Beijing&#39;s sovereignty claims, saying only the island&#39;s people can decide their future.

HOPE AND WORRY IN TAIWAN

Trump&#39;s electoral win in November has sparked hope in Taipei that he will pursue a tough line with China but also anxiety given his comments that the island should pay the US for its defence.

Trump has named numerous China hawks to key posts in his incoming administration, including Senator Marco Rubio as Secretary of State, who has called for unfettered interaction between US and Taiwan officials.

Those nominations have been encouraging for Taipei, which Reuters has reported may place large new arms deals to show it takes seriously Trump&#39;s statements that Taiwan should pay &quot;protection&quot; money to the United States.

Engagement to date between Taiwan and the incoming administration appears to fall in a gray area of unofficial contact and has been low-key. That&#39;s a departure from the period before Trump&#39;s first term, when in December 2016, the month before his inauguration, he held a phone call with then-Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen.

That call marked the first time since 1979 that a US president-elect had spoken with the island&#39;s president, a move that angered China.

Ahead of his second inauguration, scheduled for Jan 20, CBS News reported on Wednesday that Trump had invited Xi to attend the event, something that would be unprecedented for a Chinese leader.

The president-elect&#39;s camp and China did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report, but Trump said in an interview with NBC News conducted last Friday that he &quot;got along with very well&quot; with Xi and that they had &quot;had communication as recently as this week.&quot;

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Thursday lashed out at his political opponents as &quot;anti-state forces&quot;, said North Korea has hacked the country&#39;s elections and defended his short-lived martial law order as a legal move to protect democracy.

His comments on Thursday came as the leader of Yoon&#39;s own party said the president had shown no signs of resigning and must be impeached.

He faces a second impeachment vote in parliament expected on Saturday, a week after the first one failed because most of the ruling party boycotted the vote.

&quot;I will fight to the end,&quot; he said near the end of a lengthy address broadcast on television.

Yoon is under criminal investigation for alleged insurrection over the botched Dec 3 martial law declaration, which sparked the biggest political crisis in South Korea in decades.

Lawmakers broke through a police cordon, some by scaling the fence, to enter parliament and demand Yoon to rescind martial law within hours of the declaration.

In comments that echoed his justification for declaring emergency rule in the first place, he said the &quot;criminal groups&quot; that have paralysed state affairs and disrupted the rule of law must be stopped at all cost from taking over government.

Yoon said the country&#39;s National Election Commission was hacked by North Korea last year but the independent agency refused to cooperate in an investigation and inspection of its system to safeguard integrity.

He said the refusal was enough to raise questions about the integrity of the April 2024 election and led him to declare martial law.

Yoon&#39;s People Power Party (PPP) suffered a crushing defeat in the April election, allowing the Democratic Party overwhelming control of the single-chamber assembly. Even so, the opposition needs eight members of the PPP to vote with them for the president to be impeached

Just before Yoon&#39;s televised address, PPP leader Han Dong-hoon said Yoon had to be stripped of power and the only way to accomplish that is for the party to back the impeachment bill.

US President-elect Donald Trump has invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to attend his inauguration next month, CBS News reported on Wednesday, citing multiple sources.

The invitation to the Jan. 20 inauguration in Washington occurred in early November, shortly after the Nov. 5 presidential election, and it was not clear if it had been accepted, CBS reported.

The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump said in an interview with NBC News conducted on Friday that he &quot;got along with very well&quot; with Xi and that they had &quot;had communication as recently as this week.&quot;

It would be unprecedented for a leader of China, a top US geopolitical rival, to attend a US presidential inauguration.

Trump has named numerous China hawks to key posts in his incoming administration, including Senator Marco Rubio as secretary of state.

The president-elect has said he will impose an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods unless Beijing does more to stop trafficking of the highly addictive narcotic fentanyl. He also threatened tariffs in excess of 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.

In late November, China&#39;s state media warned Trump that his pledge to slap additional tariffs on Chinese goods over fentanyl flows could drag the world&#39;s top two economies into a mutually destructive tariff war.

Separately on Wednesday, China&#39;s US Ambassador Xie Feng read a letter from Xi to a US-China Business Council gala in Washington, in which the Chinese leader said Beijing was prepared to stay in communication with the US

&quot;We should choose dialogue over confrontation and win-win cooperation over zero-sum games,&quot; Xi said in the letter.

Xie added that the two countries should not decouple supply chains. But Nicholas Burns, the US ambassador to Beijing, said in a pre-recorded video address that China at times tried to &quot;sugar coat&quot; challenging and competitive relations.

&quot;No amount of happy talk can obscure our profound differences,&quot; Burns said.

Israelis and Palestinians are signaling new efforts to forge a ceasefire deal, even a limited one, for the first time in a year that would pause the fighting in Gaza and return to Israel some of the hostages still held in the Palestinian enclave.

Israel Defence Minister Israel Katz told his US counterpart Lloyd Austin in a phone call on Wednesday there was now a chance for a new deal that would allow the return of all the hostages, including US citizens, Katz&#39;s office said.

A Western diplomat in the region, however, said a deal was taking shape, but it would likely be limited in scope, involving the release of only a handful of hostages and a short pause in hostilities.

Such a truce and release would be only the second since the start of the war in October 2023.

The guarded optimism emerges as US President Joe Biden&#39;s national security adviser Jake Sullivan heads to Israel for talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday and then to Egypt and Qatar, co-mediators with the US on a deal.

Separately, President-elect Donald Trump has demanded that militants of the Palestinian Hamas group release the hostages held in Gaza before he takes over from Biden on Jan. 20. Otherwise, Trump has said, there will be &ldquo;hell to pay.&rdquo;

Trump&#39;s designated hostage envoy Adam Boehler has said he too is involved, having spoken already to Biden and to Netanyahu. Israel says 100 hostages remain captive in Gaza. Seven are believed to be US citizens.

Citing Trump&#39;s threat of &quot;hell to pay,&quot; Boehler told Israel&#39;s Channel 13 news last week: &quot;I would appeal to those people that have taken hostages: Make your best deal now. Make it now because every day that passes, it is going to get harder and harder and more Hamas lives will be lost.&quot;

Although Biden and Trump are working separately, their efforts overlap and both stand to gain from a deal. A US official said Trump&#39;s public statements about the need for a swift ceasefire &ldquo;have not been harmful.&rdquo;

The official said the priority is to get the hostages home, whether it is at the end of the Biden term or the start of the Trump term.

Steve Witkoff, Trump&#39;s designated Middle East envoy, met separately in late November with Netanyahu and Qatar&#39;s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said a source briefed on the talks.

TIMING IS APT FOR NETANYAHU

The timing for a deal may never have been better politically for Netanyahu.

The prime minister told reporters on Monday that Hamas&#39; increasing isolation following the collapse of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad&#39;s rule opened the door to a possible hostage deal even if it was too early to claim success.

Israel&#39;s military chief and the head of the Shin Bet internal security service were in Cairo on Tuesday to discuss post-war Gaza border crossings and administration, according to three Israeli security sources.

The public optimism of Israeli leaders over the past week has matched the general tone in internal discussions behind closed doors, according to an Israeli official.

For Netanyahu, concessions would be far easier now with Israel having reestablished its reputation as the most powerful Middle East force and its Iran-backed enemies in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria now posing less of a threat.

Netanyahu&#39;s once-fragile coalition has been strengthened by the addition of Foreign Minister Gideon Saar and his more centrist faction. Netanyahu, having achieved a ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon, can complete the picture with the return of the hostages in a deal with Hamas.

Over the past year, some of the far-right ministers in his cabinet had voiced objections, even threatening to bring down the government, should the war in Gaza end. But with Israel&#39;s enemies weakened, and his coalition strengthened, Netanyahu is far less vulnerable politically.

Saar said on Monday that Israel was now more optimistic about a possible hostage deal amid reports Hamas had asked other Gaza factions to help it compile a list of Israeli and foreign hostages in their custody, whether dead or alive.

A Palestinian official close to the talks and familiar with the positions of all the parties involved described what he called &quot;a fever of negotiations&quot; with ideas emerging on all sides, including among mediators in Egypt and Qatar.

Trump&#39;s involvement had given the talks a boost, even if the sides have yet to present lists of Palestinian prisoners and hostages to be exchanged or to complete plans for a temporary or phased truce, the Palestinian official said.

He said Hamas was willing to show some flexibility should there be guarantees Israel would not resume the fighting.

It is unclear how the sides can bridge the largest gap that has persisted through numerous rounds of failed negotiations; Hamas demands an end to the war, while Israel says the war will not end before Hamas no longer rules Gaza.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken headed to Jordan and Turkey on Wednesday for talks on Syria, the State Department said. Israel is not in his official itinerary but there is always a possibility he might add the stop.

The United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly voted on Wednesday to demand an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas in the Gaza Strip and the immediate release of all hostages.

The ceasefire demand in the resolution - adopted with 158 votes in favour in the 193-member assembly - was expressed in more urgent language than one urging an immediate humanitarian truce in Gaza that the body &quot;called for&quot; in October 2023 then &quot;demanded&quot; in December 2023.

General Assembly resolutions are not binding but carry political weight, reflecting a global view on the war. The United States, Israel and seven other countries voted against the ceasefire resolution, while 13 countries abstained.

The world body also threw its support behind the UN Palestinian relief agency UNRWA, adopting a second resolution with 159 votes in favour to deplore a new Israeli law that will ban UNRWA&#39;s operations in Israel from late January.

It demanded that Israel respect UNRWA&#39;s mandate and &quot;enable its operations to proceed without impediment or restriction.&quot; The US, Israel and seven other countries voted no, while 11 countries abstained.

&quot;The messages we send to the world through these resolutions matter. And both of these resolutions have significant problems,&quot; Deputy US Ambassador to the UN Robert Wood told the assembly.

&quot;One rewards Hamas and downplays the need to release the hostages, and the other denigrates Israel without providing a path forward to increasing humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians,&quot; he said.

Israel&#39;s UN Ambassador Danny Danon last week accused the UN of having &quot;an obsession with vilifying Israel,&quot; while Palestinian UN envoy Riyad Mansour described Gaza as the &quot;open, painful wound for the human family.&quot;

&#39;HUNGER, DESPAIR, DEATH&#39;

Israel says UNRWA staff took part in the Oct 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, which sparked the war in Gaza. The UN has said nine UNRWA staff may have been involved and had been fired. A Hamas commander in Lebanon - killed by Israel - was also found to have had an UNRWA job.

&quot;By voting for these resolutions, you are not voting to protect humanitarian values, but to protect an organization that has become a haven for terror,&quot; Danon told the assembly on Wednesday before the vote.

UNRWA was established by the General Assembly in 1949 following the war surrounding the founding of Israel. The UN has repeatedly said there is no alternative to UNRWA, which provides aid, health and education to millions of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.

&quot;Gaza doesn&#39;t exist anymore. It is destroyed. Palestinians are facing hunger, despair and death,&quot; Slovenia&#39;s UN Ambassador Samuel Zbogar told the assembly. &quot;There is no reason for this war to continue. We need a ceasefire now. We need to bring hostages home now.&quot;

The war in the Palestinian enclave began after Hamas gunmen on Oct 7, 2023, stormed into Israeli communities, killing around 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages back to Hamas-run Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.

Since then, Israel&#39;s military has levelled swathes of Gaza, driving nearly all of its 2.3 million people from their homes, giving rise to deadly hunger and disease and killing more than 44,800 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, who do not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants.

The main commander of the fighters who toppled Bashar al-Assad said on Wednesday that he would dissolve the security forces of the former regime, close its prisons and hunt down anyone involved in the torture or killing of detainees.

Syrian rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa - better known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani - said in a statement to Reuters he will &quot;dissolve the security forces of the previous regime and close the notorious prisons.&quot;

Syria ran one of the most oppressive police states in the Middle East during five decades of Assad family rule. Sharaa, whose former al Qaeda affiliate Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) is now the country&#39;s most powerful force, must balance demands for justice from victims with the need to prevent violent reprisals and secure international aid.

Syrians have flocked to the infamous prisons where the Assad regime is estimated to have held tens of thousands of detainees, desperately looking for their loved ones. Some have been released alive, others were identified among the dead and thousands more have not yet been found.

Sharaa said in a separate statement on the Syrian state TV&#39;s Telegram channel that people who took part in the torture or killing of detainees would be hunted down, and pardons were out of the question.

&quot;We will pursue them in Syria, and we ask countries to hand over those who fled so we can achieve justice,&quot; said Sharaa.

The world is carefully watching to see if Syria&#39;s new rulers can stabilise the country and avoid unleashing violent revenge, after a 13-year civil war fought along sectarian and ethnic lines.

Since Assad&#39;s fall, 27-year-old Hayat al-Turki has been searching the abandoned cells of Syria&#39;s most notorious prison, the vast Sednaya complex, for any sign of her missing relatives, including her brother who vanished 14 years ago.

&quot;I was hopeful and optimistic to find someone from my missing prisoners - a brother, an uncle or a cousin - but I did not... I searched the whole prison,&quot; she said.

Mohammad al-Bashir, the man installed by Sharaa&#39;s fighters to lead an interim administration until March, said he aimed to bring back millions of refugees, create unity and provide basic services.

But the new administration has scant resources, he told Italian newspaper Il Corriere della Sera.

&quot;We have no foreign currency and as for loans and bonds we are still collecting data. So yes, financially we are very bad,&quot; said Bashir, who previously ran a small rebel-led administration in a pocket of northwestern Syria.

Rebuilding Syria is a colossal task following the civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of people, reduced cities to ruins and left the economy gutted by international sanctions. Millions of refugees still live in camps after one of the biggest displacements of modern times.

ENGAGING WARILY

Foreign officials are warily engaging with the former rebels, although HTS remains designated a terrorist organisation by Washington, the United Nations, EU and others.

The new government must &quot;uphold clear commitments to fully respect the rights of minorities, facilitate the flow of humanitarian assistance to all in need, prevent Syria from being used as a base for terrorism or posing a threat to its neighbours,&quot; US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.

US Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer told Reuters Washington remains cautious.

&quot;We have seen over the years any number of militant groups who have ... promised that they would govern in an inclusive way, and then see them fail to meet those promises,&quot; State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.

In addition to terrorism bans in place against the former rebels, Syria also remains under US, European and other financial sanctions imposed against Damascus under Assad.

Two senior US congressmen, a Republican and a Democrat, wrote a letter calling for Washington to suspend some sanctions. The most punishing war-time US sanctions are up for renewal this month, and the former rebels have told Reuters they are in touch with Washington about potentially easing them.

Spain&#39;s Foreign Minister Jose Luis Albares on Wednesday said at the Reuters NEXT conference that he expected the UN and European Union to discuss easing sanctions and removing HTS from lists of terrorist organisations.

The international community must quickly demand that the rebel forces transform into a political movement and respect human rights, he added.

&quot;We must move very fast because in a month, probably, decisions will have already been taken in Damascus and we will not be able to have the impact that we can have today,&quot; Albares said.

With the administration of US President Joe Biden entering its final weeks in office, Blinken and US national security adviser Jake Sullivan headed to the Middle East on Wednesday to work on a Gaza ceasefire and help ensure a smooth transition in Syria, US officials said. Their separate itineraries include stops in Jordan, Turkey, Israel, Qatar and Egypt.

For refugees, the prospect of returning home has brought a mixture of joy and grief over hardship in exile. Syrians lined up at the Turkish border on Wednesday to head home, speaking of their expectations for a better life following what was for many a decade of hardship in Turkey.

&quot;We have no one here. We are going back to Latakia, where we have family,&quot; said Mustafa as he prepared to enter Syria with his wife and three sons at the Cilvegozu border gate in southern Turkey. Dozens more Syrians were waiting to cross.

The insurgents seize the last remaining junta-controlled border outpost, the BGP-5 battalion near Maungdaw

The Arakan Army (AA), a rebel group in Myanmar, has reportedly captured the town of Maungdaw in Rakhine state amid the ongoing conflict with government forces.

Consequently, the entirety of the 270km Bangladesh-Myanmar border is now under the control of the AA, according to a BBC report.

The insurgents seized the last remaining junta-controlled border outpost, the BGP-5 battalion near Maungdaw, on Dec 8 following months of intense fighting.

Videos released by the AA show their forces besieging the outpost with heavy gunfire, while Myanmar&rsquo;s air force launched counterattacks.

Since the military coup in 2021, which ousted Myanmar&rsquo;s democratically elected government, the country has been embroiled in a devastating civil war. The AA has been actively fighting the junta for over eight months.

Security analysts note that some Rohingya-aligned groups in Rakhine, including the Arakan Rohingya Army (ARA) and the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), initially sided with the junta. However, the latest defeat marks another significant setback for coup leader Gen Min Aung Hlaing, as the junta continues to lose strategic towns to the AA.

Earlier this year, military units, including the BGP-5 battalion, were withdrawn from Maungdaw in September. The compound, spanning approximately 20 hectares, was built on land formerly occupied by the Rohingya village of Maung Thugyi, which was burned and cleared during the military&rsquo;s violent crackdown on the Rohingya in 2017.

The scale of the fighting in Maungdaw since June suggests that the junta has suffered heavy losses, with reports of hundreds of soldiers killed. On Dec 7, the AA announced the capture of over 30 junta military camps in Rakhine&rsquo;s Ann Township, repelling air and ground attacks.

Reports indicate that Myanmar soldiers began surrendering in Maungdaw. Videos from the AA show soldiers emerging with white flags, many injured or limping. Inside the outpost, footage reveals the devastation, with piles of bodies and AA fighters celebrating their victory.

The AA claimed that over 450 junta soldiers were killed during the Maungdaw siege. They released images of captured Brig Gen Thurein Tun and other officers kneeling beneath a raised AA banner.

Pro-military commentators in Myanmar have expressed despair on social media following the fall of BGP-5, underscoring the AA&#39;s growing strength and effectiveness.

Although the AA was established relatively late, in 2009, it has emerged as one of Myanmar&rsquo;s most formidable rebel forces. However, questions remain about how the group will treat the approximately 600,000 Rohingya still living in Rakhine, especially after the military expelled over 700,000 Rohingya in 2017.

A Rohingya man who recently fled Maungdaw to Bangladesh described widespread destruction. &quot;Eighty per cent of the housing in Maungdaw and the surrounding villages has been destroyed,&quot; one Rohingya man who left Maungdaw recently for Bangladesh told the BBC.

&quot;The town is deserted. Almost all the shops and houses have been looted.&quot;

Relations between the AA and the Rohingya population have long been strained, and tensions have escalated further. Many Rohingya groups in Bangladesh refugee camps initially aligned with the junta and are now in a precarious position.

The AA has also targeted Rohingya militias tied to the junta, including the ARA, ARSA, and the Rohingya Solidarity Organisation, forcing them to abandon their bases.

Earlier this year, leaders of some Rohingya groups sought refuge in Bangladesh with weapons but were detained by local authorities.

The Myanmar government continues to deny the Rohingya citizenship, and many in Rakhine believe they should not remain in the region. A Rohingya man said, &quot;Our situation today is even more difficult than it was under the rule of the military junta.&quot;

President-elect Donald Trump is now considering tapping Richard Grenell, his former intelligence chief, to be a special envoy for Iran, according to two people familiar with the transition plans.

&quot;He&#39;s definitely in the running,&quot; said a person familiar with transition deliberations, who asked not to be identified.

No final decisions on either personnel or strategy on Iran have been made official yet by Trump, including whether to slap fresh sanctions on the country, pursue diplomacy or both in order to halt their nuclear program.

Trump&#39;s plans for the role have not previously been reported. Neither Trump&#39;s team nor Grenell responded to requests for comment.

&quot;Richard Grenell is a fabulous person, A STAR. He will be someplace, high up!&quot; Trump said in a post on his social media platform late Wednesday following the Reuters report.

Grenell, in a separate post on X, called the report &quot;wrong&quot; but gave no other details.

Still, Trump&#39;s consideration of a key ally for such a posting sends a signal to the region that the new US president may be open to talks with a country he has previously threatened and whose elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps have sought to assassinate him, according to the US government. Iran has denied the claim.

In the role, Grenell is expected to be tasked with speaking with countries in and beyond the region about the Iran issue as well as taking Tehran&#39;s temperature on possible negotiations, said one of the people.

Iran&#39;s President Masoud Pezeshkian, who is viewed as relatively moderate, said following Trump&#39;s election that Tehran must &quot;deal with the US&quot; and &quot;manage&quot; relations with its arch-foe.

Iran has suffered a series of strategic setbacks, including Israel&#39;s assault on Tehran&#39;s proxy militias Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon and the ouster of Iranian ally Bashar al-Assad in Syria.

But tensions remain high more than a year after Hamas attacked southern Israel, launching the Gaza war. Meanwhile, other Iranian proxies have attacked US, Israeli and other Western targets, and Tehran has accelerated its nuclear program while limiting the UN nuclear watchdog&#39;s ability to monitor it.

It&#39;s not the first job Trump has considered for Grenell, who served as Trump&#39;s ambassador to Germany, a special presidential envoy for Serbia and Kosovo peace negotiations, and as acting director of national intelligence during Trump&#39;s 2017-2021 term.

After campaigning for Trump in the lead up to the Nov 5 election, he was a top contender to be secretary of state and for special envoy for the Ukraine war. Those jobs went to US Senator Marco Rubio and retired lieutenant general Keith Kellogg, respectively. Trump takes office next month.

During his first term in office, in 2020, Trump ordered a US air strike that killed Iran&#39;s top military commander, Qassem Soleimani.

Trump in 2018 also reneged on a nuclear deal struck by his predecessor Barack Obama in 2015 and re-imposed US economic sanctions on Iran that had been relaxed. The deal had limited Iran&#39;s ability to enrich uranium, a process that can yield fissile material for nuclear weapons.

Iran now is &quot;dramatically&quot; accelerating enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% level that is weapons grade, the UN nuclear watchdog chief told Reuters last week. Iran says its nuclear program only serves peaceful purposes.

US President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said he was picking Kari Lake, a former news anchor and a hardline Republican who failed to win an Arizona Senate seat last month, to be the director of US government-funded media outlet Voice of America.

Trump, in a post on his Truth Social site, said Lake will &quot;ensure that the American values of Freedom and Liberty are broadcast around the World FAIRLY and ACCURATELY, unlike the lies spread by the Fake News Media.&quot;

Lake, a strong Trump supporter who has echoed his false claims about fraud at the 2020 election, also lost the governor&#39;s race in swing state Arizona in 2022 and was previously an anchor at Phoenix-based Fox 10.

Voice of America (VOA) is an international media broadcaster that operates in more than 40 languages online and on radio and television.

During his first term in office, Trump clashed with VOA and accused it of amplifying Chinese propaganda after it showed a segment on a light show marking the reopening of Wuhan, the city where the coronavirus pandemic first emerged.

Israel killed 13 Palestinians in two airstrikes in Gaza on Thursday that Gaza medics and Hamas said were part of a force protecting humanitarian aid trucks. Israel&#39;s military said they were Hamas militants trying to hijack the shipment.

Many of those killed in the attacks on Rafah and Khan Younis in southern Gaza had links to Hamas, according to sources close to the group. The 13 were among 36 Palestinians killed in separate Israeli attacks on Thursday, the medics said.

The Israeli military said in a statement the two airstrikes aimed to ensure the safe delivery of humanitarian aid and accused Hamas members of planning to prevent the aid from reaching Gaza civilians who need it.

The statement said the Hamas members aimed to hijack the aid &quot;in support of continuing terrorist activity&quot;.

Armed gangs have repeatedly hijacked aid trucks after they roll into the enclave, and Hamas has formed a task force to confront them. The Hamas-led forces have killed over two dozen members of the gangs in recent months, Hamas sources and medics said.

The Palestinian news agency WAFA said those killed in the two airstrikes were guarding the aid trucks.

Hamas said Israeli military strikes have killed at least 700 police tasked with securing aid trucks in Gaza since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023. It has accused Israel of trying to protect acts of looting and &quot;creating anarchy and chaos to prevent aid from reaching the people of Gaza&quot;.

Later on Thursday, the Israeli military ordered residents of several districts in the heart of Gaza City to evacuate, citing new rocket launches from those areas that it would respond to.

&quot;This is a pre-warning before an attack,&quot; read the military statement posted on X. The warning was also channeled to some residents through audio and written text on their mobile phones.

The evacuation orders caused a new wave of displacement. At nightfall, dozens of families streamed out of the areas heading toward the center of the city.

ISRAELI STRIKES IN GAZA CITY, CENTRAL GAZA

Children were among seven people killed when a residential building in Gaza City&#39;s al-Jalaa Street was bombed in a separate attack, WAFA said.

Another Israeli bombing killed 15 people in a house where displaced people were taking shelter, west of Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip, medics and WAFA said.

In the northern Gaza refugee camp of Jabalia, where the army has operated since October, health officials said an orthopedic doctor, Saeed Judeh, was shot dead by Israeli forces while on his way to Al-Awda Hospital where he usually treated patients.

The health ministry said his death raised to 1,057 the number of healthcare workers killed since the war began.

Months of ceasefire efforts by Arab mediators, Egypt and Qatar, backed by the United States, have failed to conclude a deal between the two warring sides.

On Wednesday, the United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly voted to demand an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire and the immediate release of all hostages seized in Israel in October 2023 and held by Hamas in Gaza.

The war in the Palestinian enclave began after Hamas gunmen stormed into Israeli communities, killing around 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages back to Hamas-run Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.

Since then, Israel&#39;s military has leveled swathes of Gaza, driving nearly all of its 2.3 million people from their homes, giving rise to deadly hunger and disease and killing more than 44,800 people, according to Palestinian health authorities.

In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where violence has surged since the Gaza war began, Israeli forces shot dead two Palestinians, at least one of them a militant, in separate raids in Nablus and Qalqilya, Palestinian and Israeli officials said.

Around 810 Palestinians, including many militants and civilians, have been killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank since October 2023.

US President-elect Donald Trump in an interview published on Thursday said he will be talking to Robert F Kennedy Jr, his nominee to run the Department of Health and Human Services, about ending childhood vaccination programmes.

When asked if he would sign off if Kennedy decided to end childhood vaccinations programmes, Trump told Time magazine, &quot;we&#39;re going to have a big discussion. The autism rate is at a level that nobody ever believed possible. If you look at things that are happening, there&#39;s something causing it.&quot;

When asked if the discussion could result in his administration getting rid of some vaccinations, Trump said: &quot;It could if I think it&#39;s dangerous, if I think they are not beneficial, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be very controversial in the end.&quot;

Asked in the Nov 25 interview if he thinks childhood autism is linked to vaccines, Trump said: &quot;No, I&#39;m going to be listening to Bobby,&quot; referring to Kennedy. Trump said he had a lot of respect for Kennedy and his views on vaccinations.

Kennedy, who opposed state and federal COVID-19 restrictions and was accused of spreading misinformation about the virus, has for years sown doubts over the safety and efficacy of vaccines, including asserting a debunked link between vaccines and autism.

Trump has suggested in the past that vaccines might be linked to autism. &quot;I want to see the numbers,&quot; he said. &quot;At the end of the studies that we&#39;re doing, and we&#39;re going all out, we&#39;re going to know what&#39;s good and what&#39;s not good.&quot;

RETRACTED AND DISCREDITED

Many of the claims that vaccines cause autism can be traced to a retracted 1998 study published in medical journal The Lancet. The paper, written by British doctor Andrew Wakefield, has been widely discredited.

Research, including a 2014 meta-analysis of studies involving more than 1.2 million children, found no association between vaccines and autism.

Autism advocacy group Autism Speaks says it &quot;remains aligned with the scientific consensus, which confirms that vaccines do not cause autism.&quot;

Former FDA commissioner and current Pfizer board member Scott Gottlieb has said if Kennedy follows through on his intentions to end vaccine mandates &quot;it will cost lives in this country.&rdquo;

He said lower vaccination rates could lead to large outbreaks of once nearly eradicated diseases like measles. &quot;For every 1,000 cases of measles that occur in children, there will be one death. And we are not good in this country at diagnosing and treating measles,&rdquo; Gottlieb told CNBC last month.

Kennedy disputes the anti-vaccine tag, but chaired the Children&rsquo;s Health Defence, a nonprofit organization that focuses on anti-vaccine messaging.

&quot;He (Kennedy) does not disagree with vaccinations, all vaccinations. He disagrees probably with some,&quot; Trump said.

If he is confirmed to run HHS, Kennedy would oversee the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, which controls what vaccines are recommended for Americans and when they should receive them. It also runs the Vaccines for Children programme that provides free vaccines for some children.

The remarks are in line with a comment Trump made in an interview with Meet The Press on Sunday in which he said that the potential risks from vaccines should be studied.

&quot;I think vaccines are &mdash; certain vaccines &mdash; are incredible. But maybe some aren&rsquo;t. And if they aren&rsquo;t, we have to find out,&quot; he said.

During a presidential debate in his 2016 White House campaign, Trump appeared to embrace the debunked autism link. He said he was &quot;totally in favour of vaccines,&quot; but suggested spreading out recommended inoculations over a longer period of time. &quot;And I think you&#39;re going to have, I think you&#39;re going to see a big impact on autism.&quot;

The moves come after the president signed an unconditional pardon for his son Hunter

Outgoing US President Joe Biden said on Thursday that he was pardoning 39 people convicted of non-violent crimes and commuting the sentences of nearly 1,500 others who were serving long prison terms.

The moves come over a week after the president signed an unconditional pardon for his son Hunter.

Officials said last week that the White House was listening to demands for Biden to extend the same grace to thousands of people wronged by the US judicial system.

The commutations on Thursday were announced for those who were placed on home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Biden said these people would have received shorter sentences if charged under today&#39;s laws, policies and practices.

Sources had told Reuters last week that the pardons being discussed included those convicted of nonviolent drug offenses and people identified by civil rights groups as unjustly incarcerated.

&quot;As president, I have the great privilege of extending mercy to people who have demonstrated remorse and rehabilitation, restoring opportunity for Americans to participate in daily life and contribute to their communities, and taking steps to remove sentencing disparities for non-violent offenders, especially those convicted of drug offenses,&quot; Biden said.

The president added that he will take more steps in the weeks ahead and that his administration will continue reviewing clemency petitions.

US Rep Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, one of the leading Democrats behind a letter to Biden last month urging him to issue clemency to Americans with nonviolent offenses, commended the president for taking &quot;meaningful and historic action.&quot;

Her statement noted that he could take further steps to exercise his power during his remaining 39 days in office.

The White House said that the clemencies granted by Biden were the most ever in a single day.

The list primarily includes Americans placed under home confinement during the Covid-19 pandemic to mitigate the spread of the virus, experts say, rather than many individuals civil rights groups have been advocating for.

&quot;We do think he can pardon more people - specifically people who are currently incarcerated and might have lower sentences if they were convicted today,&quot; said Tierra Bradford, senior program manager at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.

US President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has saidthat he would act on his first day in office to pardon rioters involved in the Jan 6, 2021, Capitol attack, further building expectations for a broad granting of clemency.

Title: India head to Gabba Test troubled by Rohit form

After missing India&#039;s big win in the first Test in Perth, Rohit dropped down the order at the Adelaide Oval where he managed just nine runs

A chastened India head to Brisbane beset by worries over the form of captain Rohit Sharma and the fitness of strike bowler Jasprit Bumrah, while resurgent Australia look to keep the momentum in the third Test starting on Saturday.

After missing India&#39;s big win in the first Test in Perth to be with his newborn son, opener Rohit dropped down the order at the Adelaide Oval where he managed just nine runs as the tourists crashed to a 10-wicket defeat inside three days.

The resumption of Rohit&#39;s run of low scores provided more ammunition for his critics, who contend that the 37-year-old is now dead weight in the team.

His former teammates are also alarmed, saying his form is affecting his captaincy following criticism of India&#39;s tactics in Adelaide.

Where Rohit fits into the Indian batting order -- or whether he fits in at all -- will continue to stoke debate in the subcontinent if the skipper fails again at the Gabba.

Though Rohit was hardly alone in struggling against the pink ball in Adelaide, his failures shone a kinder light on Bumrah&#39;s captaincy in the series opener.

Bumrah took four wickets in Adelaide but a chill went through the India camp when he went down to the turf grabbing at his inner thigh when bowling his 20th over.

Bowling coach Morne Morkel said Bumrah had suffered cramp and was otherwise completely fine but the paceman did not bowl at training until a half-hour nets session on Thursday.

Ricky Ponting said India would need something special if Bumrah missed the Test.

&quot;Bumrah&#39;s that big for India, I don&#39;t think they can win without him,&quot; the former Australia captain told local broadcaster Seven Network.

India made a raft of changes for Adelaide and may make another one following Harshit Rana&#39;s expensive, wicketless second Test.

Five-test paceman Akash Deep may be in line for a recall, while selectors could also opt for Ravindra Jadeja in place of spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, who took one wicket in Adelaide.

BITTER MEMORIES

Australia have their own selection headache in whether to retain pacer Scott Boland after his successful return with the pink ball or bring back Josh Hazlewood after his recovery from a side injury.

Though barely needed, all-rounder Mitchell Marsh bowled four overs in Adelaide and said on Thursday he was ready to pull as big a shift as needed by captain Pat Cummins at the Gabba after overcoming a back injury.

&quot;Right now it&#39;s feeling as good as it has felt,&quot; Marsh told reporters of his back.

Coming off a 295-run hammering in Perth, Australia rallied superbly in Adelaide but most of the players will have bitter memories of the last time they hosted India at the Gabba.

A rampaging Rishabh Pant smashed 89 to drive India to a nail-biting, three-wicket victory which sealed the series 2-1 and ended Australia&#39;s 33-year unbeaten run at their traditional fortress.

Though the five-Test series will still be alive after Brisbane, the stakes are high in the context of the World Test Championship.

Another defeat for India would mean their hopes of reaching the WTC final is out of their hands while putting world champions Australia within one win of next year&#39;s decider at Lord&#39;s.

South Africa&#39;s fast bowler Anrich Nortje&#39;s injury woes continued as he was on Thursday ruled out of the remainder of the Twenty20 series and three One-Day Internationals against Pakistan as they named a strong squad for the fixtures in the 50-over format.

Nortje was sidelined from September 2023 for nine months after suffering a stress fracture, although he recovered to play in the T20 World Cup where South Africa reached the final in June.

He has now suffered a toe injury that will leave him sidelined for the second and third T20 matches and the entire ODI series, which is an important warm-up for next year&#39;s ICC Champions Trophy.

Scans on Wednesday revealed a fracture and Nortje will now consult doctors to determine what treatment is needed, a Cricket South Africa statement said.

Uncapped all-rounder Dayyaan Galiem has been named as replacement for the remaining two T20 fixtures in Pretoria on Friday and at the Wanderers in Johannesburg on Saturday.

Having rested several of their regular players for the shortest format series against Pakistan, the big guns are back for the ODI games.

Batters Temba Bavuma, Tristan Stubbs and Aiden Markram make a return along with all-rounder Marco Jansen, seamer Kagiso Rabada and left-arm wrist-spinner Tabraiz Shamsi.

South Africa have also included 18-year-old firebrand fast bowler Kwena Maphaka, who gets a maiden 50-over call-up.

The series begins in Paarl on Tuesday.

South Africa ODI squad:

Temba Bavuma (captain), Ottneil Baartman, Tony de Zorzi, Marco Jansen, Heinrich Klaasen, Keshav Maharaj, Kwena Maphaka, Aiden Markram, David Miller, Andile Phehlukwayo, Kagiso Rabada, Tristan Stubbs, Ryan Rickelton, Tabraiz Shamsi and Rassie van der Dussen

Sri Lanka wicketkeeper-batsman Niroshan Dickwella has been cleared to play again after his three-year suspension for an alleged doping violation was lifted following a successful appeal, the sport&#39;s governing ICC said on Thursday.

Dickwella was suspended after failing a doping test conducted by Sri Lanka&#39;s anti-doping agency during the Lanka Premier League in August.

The 31-year-old submitted evidence showing the substance he tested positive for was unrelated to enhancing sports performance and he did not consume any banned substances during the competition period, the International Cricket Council said on its official website.

&quot;Following a successful appeal, Dickwella&#39;s ban was lifted with immediate effect and he has been granted permission to play cricket across all formats,&quot; the ICC added.

Dickwella has not represented Sri Lanka since March 2023, when he played his 54th Test match, against New Zealand.

Swashbuckling opener Tamim Iqbal has cemented his return to the field after a seven-month hiatus with his trademark swagger, smashing 65 off just 33 balls during a National Cricket League T20 match in Sylhet.

Playing for Chattogram Division against Sylhet Division on Thursday, Tamim&#39;s blistering knock featured eight fours and three sixes as he notched his 50th half-century in T20 cricket.

Alongside his record tally of fifties, he also holds the highest number of centuries (4) by a Bangladeshi batsman in the format.

The tournament marked Tamim&rsquo;s comeback to competitive cricket after an extended break. In his first match on Wednesday against Rangpur Division, he struggled, managing just 13 runs off 10 balls before being bowled out.

However, the southpaw roared back to form in the second match, lighting up the field with his explosive stroke-making.

The game, held at the outer ground of Sylhet International Cricket Stadium, saw Chattogram bat first after losing the toss. The match was reduced to 15 overs per side due to fog.

Tamim, alongside Mahmudul Hasan Joy, gave Chattogram an electrifying start, adding 80 runs in just 6.5 overs for the opening partnership.

Joy initiated the fireworks, hitting off-spinner Nayeem Ahmed for a six and a four in the first over. Tamim joined the act with a cover drive off Khaled Ahmed in the second over.

Initially, Joy set the pace, hammering experienced pacer Abu Jayed Chowdhury for a six and two fours in the third over. Tamim quickly shifted gears, smashing three consecutive boundaries off Ebadot Hossain Chowdhury in the fourth over, with two straight drives followed by a cover drive.

After that, the Bangladesh veteran dominated the partnership, racing ahead with his usual aggression. In Abu Jayed&rsquo;s next over, he struck two consecutive fours. By the end of the powerplay, Chattogram had raced to 61 for no loss in five overs.

Tamim continued his assault post-powerplay, hitting Nayeem for a four and a six off back-to-back deliveries. Joy fell in the seventh over to Ebadot for a brisk 29 off 17 balls. Tamim, however, carried on relentlessly, reaching his half-century in just 27 balls with a pull shot for four off left-arm spinner Mahfuzur Rahman Rabby. He celebrated the milestone by stepping out and smashing two consecutive sixes in the same over.

Tamim&rsquo;s dazzling innings ended when he attempted another big hit off pacer Tufayel Ahmed but was caught at long-off by Khaled, who took an excellent diving catch.

Despite the lightning start, Chattogram failed to capitalise after Tamim&rsquo;s dismissal. From 98 for 1 in eight overs, their innings collapsed, finishing at 145 for 9 in 15 overs. The team struggled to maintain momentum in the latter stages of the innings.

Zimbabwe secured victory off the last ball as they beat Afghanistan by four wickets in the first of their three-match Twenty20 series at the Harare Sports Club on Wednesday.

Tashinga Musekiwa scored the 11 runs needed off the last over for home success as Zimbabwe reached their target of 145 with six wickets down.

A 75-run partnership between Brian Bennett, who scored 49, and Dion Myers, who contributed 32, laid the foundation for the home win.

Afghanistan, who won the toss and chose to bat, scored 144-6 after Karim Janat and Mohammed Nabi put together a 79-run partnership for the sixth wicket. Janat was 54 not out and Zimbabwe&#39;s Richard Ngarava took 3-28 in his four overs.

The second match of the series is in Harare on Friday.

Title: Poor form affecting Rohit&#039;s captaincy, say former India teammates

India skipper Rohit Sharma&#39;s woeful batting form is affecting his captaincy in Australia, according to former teammates Harbhajan Singh and Cheteshwar Pujara.

Rohit has only one half-century in his last 12 Test innings, which include eight single-digit scores, and batting in the middle order in the second test brought no relief for the opener, who managed three and six in Adelaide.

Rohit missed India&#39;s comprehensive victory in the opening Test in Perth to care for his newborn son and commentators found his captaincy in Adelaide, where Australia triumphed by 10 wickets, rather defensive.

&quot;No matter how big a player is, he is always worried about his performance,&quot; former India spinner Singh told Star Sports.

&quot;There is no doubt that when a player scores runs, he makes better decisions. Let&#39;s hope that Rohit Sharma scores some runs so that his captaincy gets better.&quot;

Pujara, who was player of the series when India became the first Asian team to win a Test series in Australia in 2018-19, said getting some runs under the belt could turn Rohit into a more proactive leader.

&quot;When a captain is out of form, it affects his captaincy as well,&quot; Pujara told the broadcaster. He also advised Rohit, a naturally attacking opener, to shun risks early in his knock.

&quot;He is going through some bad form. But even then the start is very important for him,&quot; Pujara said.

&quot;He should focus on getting his first 20 or 30 runs steadily. After that, he can capitalise on the start and convert it into a big score.&quot;

KL Rahul opened for India in the first two tests but may return to middle order for the remainder of the series with Rohit reclaiming the opener&#39;s slot alongside Yashasvi Jaiswal.

The third Test in Brisbane begins on Saturday.
